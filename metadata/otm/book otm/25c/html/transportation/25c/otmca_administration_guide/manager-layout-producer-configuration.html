        <p class="p">Manager layout allows you to configure a page by adding or removing fields. The XML
            document for an object is created by a series of "producers". These producers are
            associated with objects within Oracle Transportation and Global Trade Management. Each
            manager in Oracle Transportation and Global Trade Management has an XML document
            associated with it. When you create a customer-defined manager layout, you can create or

            data that is displayed in that manager. However, the XML document may contain data that
            is no longer needed in a customer-defined manager that has had a lot of fields removed.
            By deleting the associated producers from the customer-defined manager the XML document
            will be smaller, allowing the page to load more quickly. For more details, see the <a class="xref" href="/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=otm-latest&amp;id=guide_Manager_Layout_Producers" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Manager Layout: Producers help</a>.</p>
