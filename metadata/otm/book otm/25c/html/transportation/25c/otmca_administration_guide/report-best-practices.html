                <ul class="ul" id="u30255368__ul_pnb_mps_m2c">
                    <li class="li">Create a report with facts and dimensions from same analysis folder, as
                        using a different analysis folder might yield inconsistent results. For
                        example, creating a report with Shipment Count fact from the Shipment
                        Analysis folder and Dimension from the Shipment Stop Analysis folder will
                        show inconsistent results.</li>
                    <li class="li">Always have at least one fact and one dimension in the analytical report.
                        You might see inconsistent results if ONLY dimension columns or ONLY fact
                        columns are selected in the report.</li>
                    <li class="li">Analytical reports are intended for analyzing at a higher level, meaning
                        they should always be aggregated or summarized with high level dimension.
                        For example: number of shipments and total cost by service provider in a
                        particular lane.</li>
                    <li class="li">It's always recommended to back up custom artifacts (reports and dashboards)
                        on regular basis from Oracle Analytics Server (/analytics) using the archive
                        option. This will be stored as a <code class="ph codeph">.catalog</code> file. You can
                        make a backup of BI Publisher reports, Data Visualization workbooks, and
                        analytical dashboards and reports using this option.</li>
                    <li class="li">All catalog folders in Oracle Analytics Server are read-only except the
                        custom folder. To change a default report, copy it to the custom folder and
                        edit it.</li>
                    <li class="li">Avoid saving your custom reports in the User folder; instead, use the Custom
                        folder. Reports stored in the User folder will not be retained during
                        migration from Oracle Analytics Server to Oracle Analytics Cloud.</li>
                    <li class="li">Caching is enabled in analytics, so that if the same report is run with same
                        parameters, it will get the data from BI server cache instead of from the
                        database. ETL clears the BI server cache as part of the ETL process, so it's
                        recommended to run any analytical report after 30 min of ETL completion as
                        BI server will look for cache table for every 30 min and clear the cache if
                        the cache table has entries.</li>
                    <li class="li">Analytics users should always have any of the following VPD profiles. Or,
                        you can create a custom VPD profile with all the predicates provided in
                        these VPD profiles.<ul class="ul" id="u30255368__ul_qnb_mps_m2c">

                        ETL schedules on same day.</li>
                    <li class="li">It's recommended to monitor ETL on regular basis and report any issues. This
                        avoids a bulk extract in the event ETL was stuck due to some issues and
                        wasn't running for an extended period of time. This might lead to
                        performance issues when the ETL is run again. ETL can be monitored from
                        Transportation Intelligence &gt; ETL results screen. Select âIn Progressâ Load
                        Status to monitor the running ETL process.</li>
                    <li class="li">Customers should not run lookback ETL regularly. This might impact the
                        performance as this will load the two weeks of data from the date selected
                        in the OTM. This lookback option is only meant to correct the data if there
                        were any ETL fixes.</li>
