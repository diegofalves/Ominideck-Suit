    <div class="body">
        <div class="p">There are several business processes within Oracle Transportation and Global Trade
            Management that vary Email From addresses to help communications. For example:<ul class="ul" id="u30249199__ul_g2j_wjq_mbc">
                <li class="li">
                    <p class="p"><span class="ph uicontrol">Tenders</span>: When a shipment is tendered, emails to
                        service providers use the LOGISTICS involved party on the shipment as a from
                        address. This allows the service provider to respond directly to the planner
                        when accepting the offer.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="li">
                    <p class="p"><span class="ph uicontrol">Domain Based Senders</span>: Via Domain Settings, each
                        security domain can be assigned a distinct From Address Contact ID. Email
                        sent out by users in these domains use the from address on the Contact
                        rather than the property-based common from address.</p>
                </li>
            </ul></div>
        <p class="p">Depending on your implementation, it might be straightforward to add all LOGISTICS or
            domain-based mail senders as Approved Senders, or use a few common mail domains as
            Wildcard Approved Senders. In an environment with planners across multiple email
            domains, however, this can be difficult.</p>
        <p class="p">An option is to map some or all of these From addresses to the reply-to address of the
            email, and use a single, property-based address as the from address. The Mail Delivery
            service, along with secure mail technologies such as SPF, DKIM and DMARC, check only the
            from address and its mail domain. This protects mailboxes and recipients from malicious
            mail senders. The reply-to address, however, isn't validated.</p>
        <div class="p">While using reply-to in place of a from address avoids Approved Sender and mail domain
            security requirements, it does have some disadvantages:<ul class="ul" id="u30249199__ul_xgb_fkq_mbc">
                <li class="li">
                    <p class="p">Most mail browsers display, sort and base rules on the From address.
                        Recipients with folder or spam rules can't build them up based on the
                        reply-to address. All email from the system will be viewed as coming from a
                        single from address.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="li">
                    <p class="p">When opening up an email whose planner is a reply-to address, a service
                        provider recipient will not see that planner as the from address. The
                        planner is included as a Reply To field in the standard mail content, along
                        with an HTML link to reply to that contact, and the browser Reply To will
                        respond to the planner. But the addressing on the mail header can be
                        misleading.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="li">
                    <p class="p">Standard stylesheets provided by Oracle have been updated to include the
                        Reply To field in the body of the email. Any custom stylesheets made for
                        email may or may not include this field, depending on how they were
                        developed.</p>
                </li>
            </ul></div>
        <div class="p">To use the reply-to functionality, the following properties are available:<ul class="ul" id="u30249199__ul_yfh_jkq_mbc">
                <li class="li"><code class="ph codeph">glog.mail.useReplyTo.default=[true|false]</code></li>
                <li class="li"><code class="ph codeph">glog.mail.useReplyTo.All=[true|false]</code></li>
                <li class="li"><code class="ph codeph">glog.mail.useReplyTo.&lt;Use Case&gt;=[true|false]</code></li>
            </ul></div>
        <div class="p">where <code class="ph codeph">&lt;Use Case&gt;</code> is one of: <span class="ph uicontrol">Diagnostics, Integration, Fax,
                MailValidation, NotificationContact, NotificationDomain, NotificationInvolvedParty,
                Report, TenderLogistics</span> or <span class="ph uicontrol">TrailerBuildLogistics</span>.
            The <span class="ph uicontrol">All</span> property enables reply-to mapping for all emails. The
                <code class="ph codeph">&lt;Use Case&gt;</code> property allows reply-to mapping to be enabled for
            one specific use case where they may be many from email address. For example:<ul class="ul" id="u30249199__ul_lsx_5kq_mbc">
                <li class="li">
                    <p class="p">To use reply-to address for all emails: </p>
                    <p class="p"><code class="ph codeph">glog.mail.useReplyTo.All=true</code></p>
                </li>
                <li class="li">
                    <p class="p">To use reply-to address for only Tender and Trailer Build communications:</p>

                </li>
            </ul></div>
        <div class="p">When using reply-to addresses, custom mail stylesheets may opt to include the Reply To
