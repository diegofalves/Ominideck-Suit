        <p class="p">Oracle Transportation and Global Trade Management supports communication with carriers
            via the Carrier Portal, which is a UI that can be exposed to external users for
            reviewing and accepting or rejecting shipment tenders, providing shipment status
            information, submitting invoices, and more. Alternatively, Oracle Transportation and
            Global Trade Management also supports integration with carriers in the same way as other
            external systems, as described in the âIntegrating with Other Systemsâ section of this
            document.</p>
        <p class="p">Customers who transact with many carriers might wish to consider a B2B connectivity
            partner to manage the integration process with each individual carrier. Most B2B
            providers can providing such services, though the partners identified below have created
            turn-key solutions specifically for Oracle Transportation and Global Trade Management
            customers. Please note that Oracle doesn't offer packaged integration with any of these
            partners. Rather, it's the B2B providers who own and support these integrations. Thus
            it's the responsibility of the customer to perform due diligence and identify whether
            such a solution is needed and which partner solution best fits their organizationâs
            requirements.</p>
