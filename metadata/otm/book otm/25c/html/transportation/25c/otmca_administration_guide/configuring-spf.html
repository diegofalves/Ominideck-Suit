      <div class="body">
        <p class="p">Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an internet standard for email to reduce spamming and
            other fraudulent emails by specifically identifying which Internet hosts are allowed to
            originate email for email addresses within a specific domain name. Since spamming and
            phishing attacks primarily use forged sender email addresses to lure the victims into
            opening dangerous emails (since they appear to be from trusted friends, colleagues, or
            businesses), SPF prevents this by allowing receiving email servers to reject emails that
            come from hosts that should not be originating emails with certain sender email
            addresses, therefore preserving the trustworthiness of those email addresses'
            domains.</p>
        <p class="p">SPF works by having the owner of the domain name specifically identify which public
            Internet hosts are allowed to originate email for addresses in that domain. For example,
            if the <code class="ph codeph">example.com</code> domain owner only wanted the host
                <code class="ph codeph">mx.example.com</code> to be able to publicly send emails from anyone with
            a <code class="ph codeph">user@example.com</code> email address, they could specify that with SPF, so
            any other computer that attempted to send example.com emails would have their email
            discarded when the SPF-compliant receiving email server received the forged email.</p>
        <p class="p">SPF-compliant receiving email servers look up the sending email address's domain name,
            and see if an SPF record is specified. If so, the computer attempting to send the email
            is cross-checked against the list of authorized Internet addresses in the SPF record; if
            the sending computer is not authorized, the email can be rejected or classified as
            spam.</p>
        <p class="p">Note that SPF is not used within a corporate intranet; it is implemented at the firewall
            border between a companyâs intranet and the global Internet. This is why
            company-originated emails go to the Internet through a specific border public email
            server (or redundant cloud of servers), and are similarly received by a single
            publicly-exposed entry point into the company.</p>
        <p class="p">Emails supposedly from domains that do not use SPF probably will not be trusted, as the
            domain owners appear too careless to prevent forgeries in their name.</p>
        <p class="p">Transportation and Global Trade Management can send automated emails to many users for
            many different reasons, and such emails have to have a sender email address. If the
            sender email address is not left to the standard installation setting for an Oracle
            Cloud deployment, such emails will appear as forged to the recipients' email server
            because the email server associated with the Transportation and Global Trade Management
            application server may not be on the SPF-authorized list for the Internet domain name of
            the sender email address.</p>
        <p class="p">Hence, for every sender email address configured into a Transportation and Global Trade
            Management deployment, not only do they have to be registered with the Oracle email
            service (through the registration web page in the Transportation and Global Trade
            Management web UI), but the Oracle public outbound email servers have to be listed as
            authorized email originators in the SPF records for the email addresses' domains.</p>
        <p class="p">This requires contacting the parties within your organization responsible for maintaining
            your organizationâs domain name records, and asking them to add an SPF directive to your
            domain name's SPF record authorizing the Oracle public email servers to send email on
            behalf of the configured Transportation and Global Trade Management sender email
            addresses in that Internet domain.</p>
        <p class="p">Oracle has created publicly posted SPF sublists of the Oracle Cloud public outbound email
            servers that can be conveniently included by reference in your domain name's SPF
            record.</p>
        <p class="p">The SPF is dependent on the geographic region where your service deployed. Refer to the
            following table to determine the correct SPF record corresponding to your region.</p>
        <div class="p">In your DNS setup, create a TXT record and paste the following information into the
            record based on the sending region:<table class="customlayout" style="table-layout: auto; width: 95%" summary="Use this table to determine the SPF record associated with your region."><p class="titleintable">Configuring SPF</p><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead class="thead">

            service your email needs, this SPF update should already have been done.</div>
        <p class="p">Do not use only the directive above as your entire SPF record unless you are using the
            Oracle Cloud as your sole email service provider; otherwise, specifying only the Oracle
            Cloud SPF directive may block your other legitimate email servers. For example:</p>
        <p class="p"><code class="ph codeph">v=spf1 a:mx.example.com include:spf_c.oraclecloud.com -all</code></p>
        <p class="p">would specify for the example.com domain that their public email gateway (mx.example.com)
            and the Oracle Cloud email gateways are permitted to send emails for the example.com
            domain, and all other hosts should be rejected as probable spam forgers. Consult <a class="xref" href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7208.txt" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Internet RFC 7208</a> for technical details about specifying the contents of
            your SPF record.</p>
        <p class="p">If your domain has a large quantity it may be necessary or even desirable to create a new
            domain or subdomain that is specifically intended for Oracle Cloud email, i.e.
            "mail.example.com". You should use this domain for your Approved Sender, i.e.
                "<code class="ph codeph">no-reply@mail.example.com</code>".</p>
        <div class="infobox-" id="u30225118__note_zl2_2nz_ssb"><span class="notep1">Note:</span> All domains should have an SPF record specifying which servers
            are authorized to send email to the Internet on behalf of their domain. Oracle will be
            enforcing a policy of requiring customers sending email using the Oracle Cloud to
            properly list the Oracle Cloud email servers in your domain's SPF record. Failure to do
            so could cause the Oracle Cloud to be put in a Block List by other email systems, so
            Oracle will not accept sender email addresses which would be blocked; Oracle will
            instead check your SPF record and preemptively block emails using sender domains not
            authorizing the Oracle email gateways before the emails leave the Oracle Cloud.</div>
        <p class="p">The status of each sender email address used by the system can be monitored to ensure it
            has an associated SPF record in the customerâs domain. A performance collector, MAIL
            COMMUNICATIONS, keeps track of every sender email, showing the status of each email
            address from the perspective of the domain.</p>
        <p class="p">You can review your SPF configuration with a public service like <a class="xref" href="https://dmarcian.com/spf-survey/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">dmarcian</a>.</p>
