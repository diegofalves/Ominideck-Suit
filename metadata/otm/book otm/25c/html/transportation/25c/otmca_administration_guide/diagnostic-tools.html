      <div class="body">
        <p class="p">Oracle Transportation and Global Trade Management provides an embedded logging utility.
            Application logging is configured on the page <span class="ph uicontrol">Configuration and
                Administration &gt; Power Data &gt; General &gt; Log Files</span>. Application
            logging provides detailed information about the processes running in the system. The
            output of the logging is viewed on the following page, which is accessible from all
            parent menu groups,<span class="ph uicontrol">Process Management &gt; Logs &gt; System</span>. For
            more details, see the <a class="xref" href="/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=otm-latest&amp;id=guide_System_Log" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">System Log help</a>.</p>
        <p class="p">Although logging is a vital function in Oracle Transportation and Global Trade
            Management, excessive logging is a very common cause of poor performance. This is
            particularly true of bulk planning processes. You can review what logging is currently
            enabled in the system using the page <span class="ph uicontrol">Configuration and Administration &gt;
                System Administration &gt; Logging Overview</span>. You can also temporarily
            disable all logging by setting the following
                property:<code class="ph codeph">glog.log.suppressAll=true</code></p>
        <p class="p">Setting this property can be a quick method of identifying whether logging is the cause
            of a performance issue.</p>
        <div class="infobox-"><span class="notep1">Note:</span> 
            <p class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">Logging Overview</span> screen can't be used to display summary
                information or suppress logging in Log Files of type WEB.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="p">LogIDs with a suffix of âDebugâ or âDetailsâ have the potential to log significant
            amounts of data and should be avoided unless directed to be by Oracle Technical Support.
            Ad-hoc logs are the most dangerous because they generate logging regardless of the user
            logged in. On the other hand, User logs only write to the log file when that particular
            user is logged in and using Oracle Transportation and Global Trade Management. In some
            scenarios user logs can still have a significant impact on performance, even if that
            particular user isn'tlogged in. This logging happens because there's a certain amount of
            overhead in generating a log message. The overhead occurs before Oracle Transportation
            and Global Trade Management determines, based on the logged in user that it doesn't need
            to write the message to the log file. For this reason, having many user logs with
            detailed logging enabled can have a significant impact on performance.</p>
        <div class="infobox-"><span class="notep1">Note:</span> 
            <p class="p"> Log files are limited to a maximum size of 10MB and 20 Backups.</p>
        </div>
        <section class="section" id="u30225164__section_a4x_cs2_pzb"><h3 class="title sectiontitle">Action Logging</h3>
            
            <p class="p">To streamline diagnoses of issues, OTM supports a type of logging called Action
                Logging. When running a finder/manager action, editing a top-level record or
                submitting a process control action, you can opt to turn on a log dedicated to that
                action. While the action runs, all logging needed for diagnostics is written out to
                a single, specific log file. When the action completes, you can view the focused log
                and download it for offline analysis.</p>

      <div class="body">
        <p class="p">Oracle Transportation and Global Trade Management provides embedded tools which should be
            used for investigating performance issues. The following tools are located on the menu
            at <span class="ph uicontrol">Configuration and Administration &gt; Technical Support</span>:</p>
        <ul class="ul" id="u30225165__ul_wdp_jzp_vjb">
            <li class="li">Diagnostics and Tools</li>
            <li class="li">Configuration Collection</li>
            <li class="li">Performance Collection</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">These tools provide insight into the current transactions in the system, as well as,
            historical statistics based on previous transactions. They capture data on technical
            components of the application such as data caches, workflow threads, object locks, and
            more. Diagnostics and Tools are a set of user interfaces, whereas Configuration
            Collection and Performance Collection are utilities which capture data in an XML format.
            Should performance issues occur in the system you may be requested by Oracle Technical
            Support to monitor and/or capture data from one of these utilities.</p>

      <div class="body">
        <p class="p">The Oracle Transportation and Global Trade Management Cloud Service captures a broad set
            of performance metrics. These performance metrics are persisted to the database on an
            hourly basis and are aggregated by day and week and are referred to as Historical
            Metrics. The Historical Metrics cover many technical components within the service
            including User Interface, Integration, Agents, Email and Logging. They also cover
            Infrastructure Health components including caches, connections, object locks, and
            memory. These metrics should be used to help identify, diagnose, and resolve application
            performance issues. See the <a class="xref" href="/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=otm-latest&amp;id=guide_historical_metrics" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Historical Metrics help</a> for more details.</p>
        <p class="p">Metric Collections provide a configurable mechanism for comparing Historical Metrics to a
            baseline. Email Notifications can be generated based on user defined thresholds. It is
            also possible to initiate a Diagnostic Logs capture, QDLogs, based on a defined
            threshold. This will provide additional diagnostic data for analysis by Support and
            Development. See the <a class="xref" href="/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=otm-latest&amp;id=guide_How_to_Configure_Metric_Collection" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">How to Configure Metric Collections help</a> for
            more details.</p>

      <div class="body">
        <p class="p">The Transportation and Global Trade Management Business Object caches are maintained by
            Transportation and Global Trade Management. The majority of Transportation and Global
            Trade Management Business Objects caches use a Least Recently Used (LRU) strategy to
            maintain the cache. When an LRU cache reaches its maximum, a one-for-one exchange is
            made for the new object and the least recently used object in the cache. Most static
            data used by Transportation and Global Trade Management business logic is maintained in
            one of these caches. The App-tier Caches utility page, located on the menu under
            Technical Support â Diagnostics and Tools â Caches, can be used to review statistics on
            these caches.</p>
        <p class="p">The size of a Business Object Cache can have a significant impact on performance. The
            efficiency of a cache is measured by its hit ratio. A low hit ratio is a possible
            indication of an undersized cache. If a cache has reached its capacity and the hit ratio
            is low (less than 0.80), performance may be impacted. Increasing the maximum size of
            this cache may increase system performance. Temporary changes can be made to the cache
            using the diagnostic screen, but the changes will revert to the default upon restart. To
            permanently change the size of a cache the appropriate glog.property must be set in a
            Property Set. For example, the size of the Rate Offering cache is set by the following
                property:<code class="ph codeph">glog.cache.TRateOfferingCache.capacity=2000</code></p>
        <p class="p">It is important to note that increasing the size of the cache has the adverse effect of
            increasing memory usage, so changes should be done incrementally and with thorough
            testing. Please refer to the Property Sets section of this document for more details on
            changing property value.</p>
