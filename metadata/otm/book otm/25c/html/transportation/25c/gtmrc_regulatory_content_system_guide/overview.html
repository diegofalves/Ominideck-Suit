        <p class="p">Each business transaction involves many parties. However, the companies cannot conduct
            business with any party that has been labeled as a restricted party by the governmental
            authority. The authorities publish the list of restricted parties from time to time. GTM
            provides the functionality to download these lists from any third party data content
            provider and perform screening of involved parties against the list of "Restricted"
            parties identified by the government.</p>
        <p class="p">Similarly, GTM helps users to download, update, or view product classification data and
            other related compliance elements for prompt and accurate customs filing.</p>
