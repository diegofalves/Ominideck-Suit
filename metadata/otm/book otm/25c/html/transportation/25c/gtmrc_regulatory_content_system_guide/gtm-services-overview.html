        <section class="section" id="u30227813__section_nkc_2gp_wsb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Restricted Party Screening</h2>
            
            <p class="p">The United States of America and other regional, unilateral, and multilateral
                agencies enforce regulations that restrict businesses and people from conducting
                trade with specific foreign entities (individuals, companies, countries). These
                entities are referred to as Denied, Debarred, and/or Restricted Parties. Examples of
                these entities include but are not limited to known terrorists, organizations that
                fund terrorists, and parties guilty of trade violations. Typically, the restricted
                parties are mainly countries subject to embargoes, and persons, businesses, and
                organizations subject to financial sanctions. Periodically, these agencies publish
                lists of entities that are marked as restricted parties.</p>
            <p class="p">In order to adhere to the regulations, companies screen their party master data and
                transactions against these lists, which can be very time consuming and laborious.
                Furthermore, if a business ships goods to a restricted party, it could incur fines,
                penalties, and ultimately the loss of export privileges.</p>
            <p class="p">GTM provides the functionality to download these lists from third party data content
                providers and perform screening of involved parties against the lists of
                âRestrictedâ parties identified by the government.</p>

        <section class="section" id="u30227813__section_a3l_3gp_wsb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Product Classification</h2><p class="p">The Harmonized
                Commodity Description and Coding System, also known as the Harmonized System (HS) of
                tariff nomenclature, is an internationally standardized system of names and numbers
                to classify traded products. HS codes are used by customs authorities, statistical
                agencies, and other government regulatory bodies to monitor and control the import
                and export of commodities through:</p><ul class="ul" id="u30227813__ul_bhn_kgp_wsb">
                <li class="li">Customs tariffs</li>
                <li class="li">Collection of international trade statistics</li>
                <li class="li">Rules of origin</li>
                <li class="li">Collection of internal taxes</li>
                <li class="li">Trade negotiations (e.g. the World Trade Organization schedules of tariff
                    concessions)</li>
                <li class="li">Transport tariffs and statistics</li>
                <li class="li">Monitoring of controlled goods (e.g. wastes, narcotics, chemical weapons, ozone
                    layer depleting substances, endangered species, etc.)</li>
                <li class="li">Areas of customs controls and procedures, including risk assessment, information
                    technology and compliance</li>
            </ul><p class="p">In addition, before you can export or import a product, you must identify your
                productâs proper Schedule B (for US exports) or Harmonized Schedule (HS) (for
                imports) number. This number must appear on both the export and the import
                documentation that accompanies a shipment.</p><p class="p">Companies use HS codes to calculate
                the total landed cost of imported products and parts, and to identify selling and
                sourcing opportunities abroad. Companies also use harmonized tariffs to determine if
                their goods can take advantage of preferential trade programs and trade agreements.
                GTM helps you to download, update, or view product classification data and other
                related compliance elements for prompt and accurate customs filing.</p><p class="p">Some
                products (such as munitions and computer hardware) exported from the United States
                require an export license from either the U.S. Department of Commerce or another
                U.S. agency like the State Department. Before you can determine whether your product
                requires an export license, you must investigate if your product has an Export
                Control Classification Number (ECCN).</p> Finally, some countries also provide
            munitions lists, which may include services and technology that are related to defense
            or space. In some instances, customers may also need to assign munitions list numbers to
            their items.</section>
        <section class="section" id="u30227813__section_hcg_mgp_wsb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Trade Agreements and Rules of Origin</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Trade agreements are treaties/terms involving taxes and tariffs for cross-border
                shipments. Two or more countries agree upon trade agreements to reduce their own
                customs duties and those of their customers. </p>
            <p class="p">Rules of origin are available for trade agreements across the globe and support rule
                types such as tariff shift, regional value content method, de minimis, HS inclusion,
                HS exclusion, and wholly obtained goods. You can download trade agreements and Rules
                of Origin data from third party content providers.</p>
            <p class="p">GTM provides features that help you to determine if goods you manufacture qualify for
                trade agreements based on the associated Rules of Origin. If your finished goods
                qualify for a trade agreement, you can produce the appropriate certificates of
                origin and provide them to your customers. This results in a cost-effective business
                transaction.</p>
