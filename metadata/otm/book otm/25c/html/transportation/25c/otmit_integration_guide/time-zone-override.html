        <p class="p">Generally, time information sent in the inbound XML to Transportation and Global Trade
            Management Cloud is associated with a time zone for a particular location and time zone
            offset. For example, the early pickup dates and late delivery dates on a transportation
            order line (within the TransOrder interface) are associated with the ship from and ship
            to locations for the order line, and each of those locations is associated with a
            specific time zone. The time information sent in the early pickup date and late delivery
            dates elements are assumed to be in the time zone of the location. So, if your time is
            at 8 AM and the location is King of Prussia, PA, you would specify the time in the XML
            as 080000 (HHMISS, where HH=Hours, MI=Minutes and SS=Seconds) and Transportation and
            Global Trade Management Cloud would understand this to mean 8AM in the America/New York
            time zone.</p>
        <p class="p">For systems that only maintain their times in a single time zone, or in other
            circumstances when you are unable to specify times as expected in the time zone of the
            corresponding locations, an override can be specified to indicate the time zone for all
            times for the transaction. As an example, if your sending application maintains all
            times in a specific time zone such as San Francisco where the early pickup date is
            maintained as 5 AM, it would be possible to send 050000 as the time to Transportation
            and Global Trade Management Cloud and indicate an override that all the times in the
            transportation order are specified in the America/Los_Angeles time zone.</p>
        <p class="p">A valid time zone override can be specified in the TimeZoneGid element within the
            Transaction Header. When the TimeZoneGid is specified, it will be assumed that all the
            times within the transaction (GLogXMLElement) are in that time zone.</p>
