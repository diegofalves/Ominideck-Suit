    <div class="body">
        <p class="p">After your Cloud Service order has been placed with Oracle, you will receive an email
            entitled "Action Required: Welcome to New Oracle Cloud Service Subscriptions". This
            means you have been designated as the activator of the services. The activator only
            kicks off the provisioning process and can select a different Service Administrator to
            manage the day to day administration of the service during the activation process if
            required. Carefully review the details of your subscription in the email and follow the
            instructions below to begin the activation process.</p>
        <p class="p">An important decision needs to be made at this time. You will need to choose whether to
                <span class="ph uicontrol">"Create new cloud account"</span> or to <span class="ph uicontrol">"Add to existing
                cloud account"</span>. Your Cloud Account is where you will manage
            Transportation and Global Trade Management, but also all other Oracle Cloud Services
            that you purchase.</p>
        <p class="p">If you have previously subscribed to other Oracle Cloud Services, you will already have a
            Cloud Account. If you choose <span class="ph uicontrol">"Add to existing cloud account"</span>,you
            will be prompted to provide the name of that Cloud Account and log in. Once this is
            complete, you can proceed to the next step "<span class="ph uicontrol">Environment
                Activation</span>".</p>
        <p class="p">If you have not previously subscribed to other Oracle Cloud Services, you will need to
            create a new Cloud Account. Even if you have an existing Cloud Account, you can still
            choose to create a new Cloud Account for Transportation and Global Trade Management
            Service.</p>
        <div class="infobox-" id="u30230659__note_btv_bjs_5tb"><span class="notep1">Note:</span> 
            <ul class="ul" id="u30230659__ul_hq2_djs_5tb">
                <li class="li">This Cloud Account Name will also be used to create the URLs to access all your
                    Cloud services (not just Oracle Transportation Management and Global Trade
                    Management) and it is not possible to change it, so please choose carefully. For
                    example, if you call your Oracle account "ABCCorp" your OTM Application URL will
                    look something like:
                    https://otmgtm-ABCCorp.otmgtm.us-phoenix-1.ocs.oraclecloud.com.</li>
                <li class="li">The Cloud Account Name must be unique, it must start with a lowercase letter and
                    can have up to 25 lowercase letters and numbers. You cannot use spaces or any
                    special characters.</li>
                <li class="li">Provide the Name and Email Address of the person that will be the Service
                    Administrator. This person will receive an email with instructions and the Cloud
                    Portal login for creating the Cloud Service Environments.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="p">The value you provide in the <span class="ph uicontrol">"Tenancy Name"</span> field will be used as
            the name of your Cloud Account and your Cloud Infrastructure Tenancy. A Tenancy is a
            secure and isolated partition within Oracle Cloud Infrastructure where you can create,
            organize, and administer your cloud resources. In addition to the Tenancy Name, you will
            need to provide the Name, Email Address, and Default Password for the Service
            Administrator.</p>
        <p class="p">You will also need to specify the "Home Region." Your Home Region is the geographic
            location where your cloud account and identity resources will be created. It is not
            changeable after sign-up. For SaaS application(s) the Home Region does not indicate the
            provisioning location. Your SaaS application(s) will be provisioned in the geo-region
            specified on your order. After creating a cloud account to add your subscription, the
            Home Region is where your primary Identity Domain will be located. Depending on SaaS
            applications the application user credentials may also be stored at the same Home Region
            Identity Domain location.</p>
        <div class="infobox-" id="u30230659__note_cbx_fdh_vwb"><span class="notep1">Note:</span> 
            <p class="p">For optimal performance, Oracle recommends the Identity Home and the SaaS Service be
                provisioned in the same region.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="p">Once you have entered all of the required fields, please read the Terms of Service and
            click the <span class="ph uicontrol">Create Tenancy</span> button.</p>
