    <div role="main">
      <p>This page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Shipment Management &gt; Itinerary Management &gt; Itinerary Leg Manager.</span></p>
      <p>The Leg Detail page defines requirements associated with a particular location. For example, leg details can specify scheduling priorities, rates, intermediate stops, service providers, commodities, and modes of transport. In order to use an itinerary, shipments must be able to adhere to these requirements.</p>
      <h2><a id="Adding_an_Itinerary_Leg"></a>Adding an Itinerary Leg</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter an <span class="Bold">Itinerary Leg Name</span>.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If entering an Itinerary Leg from an <a href="create_leg_detail.htm">Itinerary Leg Detail</a>, instead of entering an Itinerary Leg Name, a Sequence Number is entered.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Define the <span class="Bold">Primary Leg</span> for multi-leg itineraries. The primary leg obeys the constraints of order releases that use the itinerary. For example, it uses the transport mode, service provider, and equipment that appear on the order release.</li>
        <li>Enter a <span class="Bold"><a href="../rate_manager/create_rate_offering.htm">Rate Offering</a></span> <span class="Bold">ID</span> to indicate that a specific rate offering must be used for any shipment that is created for this leg. Oracle Transportation Management then selects an appropriate rate record for that rate offering.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, you can specify that a <span class="Bold"><a href="../rate_manager/create_rate_record.htm">Rate Record</a></span> must be used.</li>
        <li>Assign a <span class="Bold"><a href="leg_classification.htm">Leg Classification</a></span> to label the itinerary or to have <a href="../order_manager/order_plan_constraints.htm#leg">order release constraints</a> applied to this leg when building shipments from this leg.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Ignore Representative Location</span> checkbox specifies whether Network Routing logic will ignore the <a href="../power_data/geography/regions.htm#representative_location">representative locations</a> of the source and destination regions of the leg. By default, this field is left unchecked.</li>
        <li>If the itinerary is used by shipments carrying hazardous material, enter a <a href="../power_data/geography/regions.htm"><span class="Bold">Hazmat</span> <span class="Bold">Region ID</span></a>. When carrying hazardous material, shipments must obey rules based on the region where the material is going.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold"><a href="../power_data/corporations/corporations.htm">Intermediary Corporation</a></span> defines a 3PL or other intermediary associated with the leg. An intermediary corporation contracts with a service provider to move freight on behalf of the customer. Use this field to identify the corporation that acts as the intermediary. Oracle Transportation Management copies <a href="../../general/order_involved_party.htm">involved party contacts</a> to shipments and bills based on your entry for this leg.</li>
        <li>Enter a <span class="Bold"><a href="network_manager.htm">Network ID</a></span> if the itinerary leg has an embedded network. You cannot specify both a Network ID and a Cross Dock Location.</li>
        <li>Use the <a href="../location_manager/location_identification.htm"><span class="Bold">Cross</span> <span class="Bold">Dock Location ID</span></a> to associate the current leg with a cross-dock. Shipments that qualify go to the cross-dock before the destination defined on the leg. Shipments stop at the cross-dock and the orders are re-planned with orders on other shipments before proceeding to the leg destination. Enter details that determine which shipments use the cross-dock on the Step 1: Itineraries Parameters page. You cannot specify both a Network ID and a Cross Dock Location.</li>
        <li><a name="equip_assignment" id="equip_assignment"></a>During planning, Oracle Transportation Management can assign equipment based on the attributes of the order/shipment (such as weight, size, and volume) and the equipment that is recorded in the database. You can use the following <span class="Bold">Equipment Assignment Type</span> options on each leg of an itinerary to control how Oracle Transportation Management makes equipment assignments for that leg.
          <ul>
            <li><span class="Bold">Optimize Equipment</span> allows Oracle Transportation Management to choose the appropriate equipment for each leg of the shipment. Oracle Transportation Management uses the container optimization algorithm to plan the appropriate equipment for subsequent legs. For example, you may have equipment used for drayage on the first leg of a shipment but different equipment used for ocean legs.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold"><a name="reuse_equipment" id="reuse_equipment"></a>Re-use Equipment</span> uses the same equipment that was selected for the previous leg (as defined in Scheduling Priority above) of the itinerary. You would typically use this attribute on legs subsequent to the first leg to constrain the use of the same equipment group across legs. When used on the first leg, this works the same as Optimize Equipment. This flag is not considered for order movement planning. Order movement planning will not produce shipments on different legs that share the same equipment.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">No Equipment</span> does not assign any equipment and skips container optimization during shipment planning.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Allocation Group ID</span> provides a direct association between the leg and the allocation. This allocation group is used to match the allocation group on the commitment allocation record if the parameter <a href="../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm#allocation_group_strategy">Allocation Group Strategy</a> is set to &#39;1. Use Allocation Group on Leg&#39;.</li>
        <li>By default, Oracle Transportation Management creates separate shipments for each leg that requires more than one equipment based on the container optimization results. However, you can mark the <span class="Bold">Create Single Shipment</span> checkbox to have Oracle Transportation Management create one shipment for the leg and assign multiple equipment. If you want to place multiple equipment on the same shipment, then you must select this checkbox.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Payment Method Code</span> identifies the manner in which <a href="../shipment_manager/shared_tabs/ship_mgrs_financials.htm">payment</a> is made on a shipment. The payment method code from the order base is copied to each shipment that is created from the order base unless you have specified payment method codes on the legs of the itinerary that was used to create this shipment. In this case, the payment method code on the leg of the itinerary is copied to the shipment (overriding the code specified on the order).</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a name="auto_consolidation" id="auto_consolidation"></a>Auto Consolidation Type</span> defines the way shipments on this leg get consolidated. Choose one of the following options:
          <ul>
            <li><span class="Bold">No Auto Consolidation</span> indicates that there is no consolidation or multi-stop planning on this leg.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Multi-stop into One Equipment</span> indicates that shipments built on this leg are sent to multi-stop algorithm to consolidate into multi-stop shipments with one piece of equipment for each multi-stop shipment. Only the first leg and last leg of an itinerary can have this Auto Consolidation Type.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Consolidate into One Equipment</span>: indicates that shipments built on this leg with the same Source and Destination Locations are consolidated together if they can fit into one piece of equipment.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Consolidate into One Shipment/Multiple Equipment</span> indicates that all shipments built on this leg will be consolidated into one shipment (if time window is feasible) with multiple equipment.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The following rules apply for Auto Consolidation, Equipment Type, and Create Single Shipment options:
          <ul>
            <li>Only the first and last leg of an itinerary can have the Multi-stop into One Equipment Auto Consolidation Type.</li>
            <li>The Equipment Assignment Type of the first leg can not be Re-use Equipment</li>
            <li>If a leg&#39;s Equipment Assignment Type is Optimize Equipment and its Auto Consolidation Type is either Consolidate into One Equipment or Consolidate into One Shipment/Multiple Equipment, the next leg&#39;s Equipment Assignment Type must be Re-use Equipment and all subsequent leg&#39;s Auto Consolidation Type cannot be No Auto Consolidation.</li>
            <li>If a leg&#39;s Equipment Assignment Type is Optimize Equipment and its Auto Consolidation Type is No Auto Consolidation, its next leg&#39;s Equipment Assignment Type must be Re-use Equipment and all subsequent Re-use Equipment legs&#39; Auto Consolidation Type cannot be Consolidate into One Equipment or Multi-stop into One Equipment.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>If Create Single Shipment is marked, the Auto Consolidation type cannot be Consolidate into One Equipment or Multi-stop into One Equipment.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>If a leg&#39;s Equipment Assignment Type is Re-use Equipment, this leg&#39;s Equipment Group Profile/ Equipment Group Profile Set must be the same as the previous leg.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Use Consol</span> checkbox to indicate that this itinerary leg can be used as a candidate for building a consol shipment for a charter voyage or flight.</li>
        <li>Enter a <span class="Bold"><a href="../power_data/25_general/leg_consolidation_group.htm">Leg Consolidation Group ID</a></span>.</li>
        <li>Enter <span class="Bold"><a href="../../field_definitions/via_locations.htm">VIA Locations</a></span>. If using <a href="../rate_manager/using_arbitraries.htm">arbitraries</a>, via locations indicate which locations can be used as arbitrary-related stops on the shipment.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: For itinerary legs, you should not use a VIA Source Location ID with a VIA Dest Location Profile ID, and vice versa. It works if the location profile has only one location, but will not work otherwise. You can use a VIA Source Location ID with a VIA Dest Location ID.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Select a <span class="Bold">Trans-shipment Arbitraries Search Type</span>.</li>
        <li>Enter a <span class="Bold"><a href="../power_data/corporations/depot_profile.htm">Depot Profile ID</a></span> to override the depot profile on the <a href="itinerary_parameters.htm">itinerary</a> for order release and order movement planning.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Destination Location</h2>
      <p>This section defines the destination location of a leg. Define the destination as a particular location, group of locations, or as a radius where different points within the area can act as a destination. Also, assign a role to the destination describing the type of activity that occurs there.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: For the final leg of the itinerary you can leave this section blank. Oracle Transportation Management assumes that the destination of the final leg of the itinerary is the same as the destination on the order. OR, if you leave the destination information blank for any leg, Oracle Transportation Management can create intermediate legs using the destination on the order.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="../location_manager/location_roles.htm">Location Roles</a></span> determines the type of shipment related activity that occurs at a location.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If you complete this field, you must enter a value in the Location ID, Location Profile, or Location Radius fields.</p>
        </li>
        <li><a name="operational" id="operational"></a>When the <span class="Bold">Assign Operational Locations to Stops</span> checkbox is selected, Oracle Transportation Management uses the Operational Location assigned to the Destination Location for this leg. Operational Locations are used when transporting goods to and from ports, airports, or rail ramps. They allow you to define different points within a location that goods are delivered to or picked up from. They are defined in the <a href="../location_manager/operational_locations.htm">Operational Location</a> section of the Location Manager. When this option is selected, Oracle Transportation Management makes the Operational Location the Location for the stop, and makes the main location the Parent Location. This can be seen in the view shipment page after it is planned.</li>
        <li>Select a <span class="Bold">Location ID</span> to identify the destination as a specific location.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Location Radius</span> field creates a radius around the destination location. The leg can use any location within the radius with the same role as the destination location. Enter a numeric value and a distance measure (miles, kilometers, or nautical miles) to represent size of the area. You can limit the number of locations that are evaluated by the planning logic when building a shipment by using the <span class="Bold">Max Location Count</span> field.</li>
        <li>You can use the <span class="Bold">Location Radius Emphasis</span> field to determine the location that acts as the geographic center for the location radius. Make a selection from the Location Radius Emphasis drop-down menu: Select Order Source or Order Destination to assign a radius around locations defined on the order, or select Leg Location to assign the location defined on the leg.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: For itineraries based on regions, if the Location Radius Emphasis field is valued, but the Location Radius field is not, destination locations are determined based on the region ID and the location role defined on the leg. All locations in the region with the same location role as the one defined on the itinerary can act as the destination. You can use this method to pinpoint locations in a region as destination that have specific roles, such as airports or seaports.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Enter a <span class="Bold"><a href="../power_data/corporations/loc_profile.htm">Location Profile</a></span> to identify a specific list of locations that can be used for the destination. Location profiles are created in Power Data.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="leginterimpoints" id="leginterimpoints"></a>Leg Interim Points</h2>
      <p>A leg interim point adds one or more stops between the source and destination locations. For example, you can use interim points to identify a border crossing or a stop over during the night. An interim point is a reference point for shipment activity, where nothing is loaded or unloaded from the equipment.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Calendars on interim stops are not considered. Calendars on interim stops do not work with service time calculation and LOAD/RECEIVE calendars are only for pickup and dropoff stops (which interim stops cannot do).</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select an <span class="Bold"><a href="../../field_definitions/interim_points.htm">interim point option</a></span>.</li>
        <li>Enter a value in the <span class="Bold">Sequence Number</span> field that determines the order in which the interim stops occur. The Interim Points are listed in ascending order by their sequence number.</li>
        <li>Enter a <span class="Bold">Location ID</span> for the location of the interim stop.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="Bold">Save</span> for each interim point sequence number you enter.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="costservice" id="costservice"></a>Cost/Service</h2>
      <p>This section determines the estimated cost and travel time for the leg.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: The intended use for the Expected Cost and Expected Time fields on the leg is for direct shipments only.Â When this setup is used within a one-leg itinerary, OTM will build direct shipments for each of the order bundles in the plan and will assign the expected cost and expected time to each of the shipments generated.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Calculate Contracted Rate</span> checkbox if you want Oracle Transportation Management to calculate the cost and service time associated with the leg. When selected, Oracle Transportation Management runs processing to locate a rate for the leg. Oracle Transportation Management searches for a rate based on the lane information and matches that to the source and destination on the leg of the itinerary.</li>
        <li>If you clear the Calculate Contracted Rate checkbox, the value you enter in the <span class="Bold">Expected Cost</span> field will be the cost calculated for the shipment; if you clear the checkbox and do not enter a value then the base cost for the shipments planned on this leg will be 0.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Calculate Service Time</span> checkbox to allow OTM to select the service time from the rate offering that applies to the leg. Service time is made up of details such as, drive time, work time, and rest time which are associated with traveling from one location to another. For the transportation modes air, rail, and vessel travel, the service times are calculated based on transportation schedules available for each mode.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If using arbitrary locations on an itinerary, this checkbox must be selected, otherwise OTM will not be able to calculate a service time for that leg and when trying to plan the order via show routing options, planning will fail.</p>
        </li>
        <li>If you clear the <span class="Bold">Calculate Service Time</span> checkbox, the value you enter in the <span class="Bold">Expected Transit Time</span> field will be the transit time used for shipments planned using this leg. Enter the service time value you want to use and then select a time duration (e.g., days, weeks, months) for travel time; if you do not enter a value then OTM will not calculate any transit time between the stops for shipments planned using this leg. When you select an itinerary, OTM converts the Expected Transit Time unit of measure to the unit of measure in your user preferences. For example, if you enter 3 days, and your preferred unit of measure for duration is hours, OTM converts the Expected Transit Time to 72 hours.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Except for the primary leg, all other legs should have an Expected Transit Time which is used to create time windows on the order movements.</p>
          <p>Here&#39;s how the <span class="Bold">Calculate Contracted Rate</span> and <span class="Bold">Calculate Service Time</span> checkbox work together:</p>

                <td>
                  <p>Not Supported Â there is no way for OTM to discover the rate service without a rate. In this case, the rate is meant to be what is entered on the itinerary leg and you want the service to be determined. However, without a rate and therefore a related rate service, OTM cannot calculate a service time.</p>
                  <p>OTM throws an exception stating that this case is not supported.</p>

        <li>During shipment planning, a service provider is assigned to each shipment based on the attributes of the order, itineraries, and rates defined in the database. You can use the following <span class="Bold">Service Provider Assignment Types</span> on each leg of an itinerary to control how service provider assignments are made.
          <ul>
            <li><span class="Bold"><a name="reuse_servprov" id="reuse_servprov"></a>Re-use Service Provider</span> uses the same service provider that was selected for the first leg of the itinerary. You would typically use this attribute on legs subsequent to the first leg to constrain the use of the same service provider across legs. When used on the first leg, this works the same as Optimize Equipment.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Optimize Service Provider</span> allows Oracle Transportation Management to choose the cheapest service provider for each leg of the shipment.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Compatibility</h2>
      <p>This section defines the mode of transportation, the service provider, and special equipment required for the leg.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="../power_data/service_provider/mode_profile.htm">Mode Profile</a> IDs</span> are groups of transportation modes that have similar attributes. Only shipments that use transportation modes that are included in the mode profile can use this itinerary. Define mode profile IDs in Power Data.</li>
        <li>
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If the order does not have a transport mode, then Oracle Transportation Management selects one on based on the rate. If Oracle Transportation Management chooses a mode from the rate, then the Mode Profile field on the itinerary is not used.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Use the <span class="Bold">Service Provider Profile ID</span> field to assign a particular service provider.</li>
        <li>You can identify and define a group of rate services that have some similar attributes. This group is called a <span class="Bold"><a href="../power_data/rates_and_codes/rate_service_profiles.htm">Rate Service Profile</a></span>. A Rate Service determines the time required to transport goods from one location to another.</li>
        <li>Use the <span class="Bold"><a href="../equip_manager/create_equip_grp_pro.htm">Equipment Group Profile</a></span> <span class="Bold">ID</span> to limit the equipment choices allowed for this itinerary leg. For example, you can create a Group Profile called Dry Vans that include the 28 FT Dry Van and 24 FT Dry Van Equipment Groups. Define Equipment Group Profile ID in the Equipment Manager.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="../equip_manager/create_equip_group_prof_set.htm">Multi-Modal Equipment Sets</a></span> allows Oracle Transportation Management to evaluate multiple equipment options within an itinerary for both the multi-leg and multi-stop algorithms. You can specify an equipment group profile set on the leg of an itinerary that supports multi-stop planning. You can specify a single equipment group profile or a set containing multiple equipment group profiles and Oracle Transportation Management will select the best fit equipment group from within each profile and rate it. The least-cost feasible option across all these equipment groups will be chosen.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Involved Party</h2>
      <p>Use this section to assign <a href="../../general/order_involved_party.htm">involved parties</a> to the itinerary.</p>
      <h2>Commodities</h2>
      <p>You can define a particular <span class="Bold"><a href="../material_manager/create_flex_commod.htm">Flex Commodity Profile</a></span> (e.g., meats, vegetables, or pens) to the leg. Only the <a href="../material_manager/create_commodity.htm">commodity</a> you enter can be carried on this leg of the shipment.</p>
      <h2>Rail</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Rule 11 Instruction</span> field specifies whether the leg of a shipment is governed by the rail industry&#39;s Rule 11 provision for interline shipments. If Rule 11 does not apply to the leg, select the default value, NOT RULE 11. If the leg is the tendered first leg of a Rule 11 shipment, select TENDER THIS SHIPMENT. If the leg is the non-tendered second leg of a Rule 11 shipment, select SETTLEMENT ONLY, NO TENDER. The Rule 11 Instruction pertains to Rule 11 shipments, but the other fields can be used for any type of rail shipment.</li>
        <li>
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Rule 11 shipments can be combined with other shipments.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The <a href="../power_data/rates_and_codes/rail_imod_servplan_code.htm">Rail Intermodal Service Plan Code</a> is a two-digit code identifying the type of intermodal service plan for this leg (for example, 15 for Plan 15, ramp-to-ramp). These codes are determined by the American Association of Railroads (AAR).</li>
        <li>Use <span class="Bold">Customer or Shipper Rate</span> to specify whether the rate for this leg of a shipment was agreed upon between the rail carrier and the customer or the shipper.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Typically, the tendered first leg of a Rule 11 shipment uses a shipper rate, and the non-tendered second leg uses a customer rate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Use <span class="Bold">COFC/TOFC</span> to specify the mode of the rail shipment. The options are CONTAINER ON FLAT CAR (COFC), TRAILER ON FLAT CAR (TOFC), and CONTAINER AND CHASSIS ON FLAT CAR. In most cases, rates for COFC shipments are lower than those for TOFC shipments because containers can be double-stacked on flat cars, but trailers cannot.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a href="../../schedule_manager/ground_schedule.htm">Schedules</a></h2>
      <p>Use this section to assign one or more Static or Dynamic Trip Templates to an itinerary leg. Trip templates are used for creating empty shipments for a predetermined route and then moving order releases on to those shipments.</p>
      <h2>Equipment Capacity Override</h2>
      <p>Use this section to assign one or more <a href="../power_data/geography/capacity_overrides.htm"><span class="Bold">equipment capacity overrides</span></a> that model weight and volume restrictions for a leg.</p>
      <p>The Capacity Override has an effective date and expiration date. If the Capacity Override Lead Time is not populated, then the order (or order bundle) pickup and delivery time windows will be compared to the effective time window for the Capacity Override, and if there is any overlap in the time windows then the override can be applied. Setting the Capacity Override Lead Time will further restrict which orders are applicable. The lead time is added to the order early pickup (or late pickup if early pickup is null) and then the Capacity Override can only be applied if this time is later than the effective date for the Capacity Override.</p>
      <h3>For Example</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Order has early pickup date of today and late delivery is one month out.</li>
        <li>Capacity Override effective date is 15 days out.</li>
        <li>If the Capacity Override Lead Time is not populated, then the Capacity Override would apply because the late delivery for the order is after the effective date.</li>
        <li>If the Capacity Override Lead Time is set to a duration less than 15 days, then the Capacity Override would not apply because the early delivery plus lead time is earlier than the effective date.</li>
      </ul>
