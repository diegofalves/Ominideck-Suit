  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Secondary Charge Rule</span></h1>
  <div role="main">
    <p>This page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Shipment Management &gt; Power Data &gt; Shipment Configuration &gt; Secondary Charge Rule</span>.</p>
    <p>Secondary charge rules automatically assign secondary charges when buy shipments and shipment groups are built.</p>
    <p>When you create a secondary charge rule, you define it by the transportation mode to which it applies, as well as by the applicable rate information and service provider (from whom payment is due). Additionally, you can limit secondary charge rules by date and other parameters.</p>
    <p>When Oracle Transportation Management creates shipment groups, the shipment group rules indicate when secondary charges are applied to a specific group. Oracle Transportation Management then runs the secondary charge rules and creates the appropriate secondary charge and associates it with the shipment group for reference. You can also view secondary charges in the Shipment Manager.</p>
    <h2><a name="header" id="header"></a>General Information</h2>
    <p>The <span class="Bold">Secondary Charge Rule ID</span> field uniquely identifies the secondary charge rule. If needed, type a brief <span class="Bold">Description</span> of the rule. Then select the <span class="Bold">Domain Name</span> to be associated with the rule, if not the current domain.</p>
    <p>The <span class="Bold">Rule Type</span> specifies whether the rule applies to <span class="Bold">Shipments, Shipment Groups, Shipment Special Service, Shipment Stop,</span> and <span class="Bold">Stop Special Service</span>. If Shipment, Shipment Group, Shipment Special Service, or Stop Special Service is selected as the rule type, additional rule conditions appear below in the Criteria section.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If Shipment Special Service or Stop Special Service is selected as the applicable rule type, the rule will be ignored by the logic that automatically creates secondary charge shipments. You should run the manual action or create an agent action.</p>
    <p>Your selection of Location Type will determine how the source and destination locations are set.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="Bold">Destination</span>: Use the destination of the transportation shipment or shipment group as the source and destination locations of the secondary charge shipment.</li>
      <li><span class="Bold">Port of Discharge</span>: Use the port of discharge of the primary leg shipment or port of discharge of the shipment group as the source and destination locations of the secondary charge shipment.</li>
      <li><span class="Bold">Port of Load</span>: Use the port of load of the primary leg shipment orÂ port of discharge of the shipment group as the source and destination locations of the secondary charge shipment.</li>
      <li><span class="Bold">Source</span>: Use the source location of the transportation shipment or shipment group as the source and destination locations of the secondary charge shipment.</li>
      <li><span class="Bold">Source to Destination</span>: Use the source and destination locations of the transportation shipment orÂ shipment group as the source and destination locations of the secondary charge shipment.</li>
      <li><span class="Bold">Stop:</span> Use the third party service stop location as the source and destination locations of the shipment. Â This choice is only available when the rule type is designated as Stop Special Service or Shipment Stop.</li>
      <li><span class="Bold">All</span>: When selected, all stops of the shipment will be copied to the secondary charge shipment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Notes</span>: When the selected Location Type is Port of Discharge, the <span class="Bold">Port of Load Profile ID</span> field in the Criteria section is replaced by the <span class="Bold">Port of Discharge Profile ID</span> field.<br>
      When the selected Location Type is Port of Loading, the <span class="Bold">Port of Discharge Profile ID</span> field in the Criteria section is replaced by the <span class="Bold">Port of Load Profile ID</span> field.</p>
    <p>Regardless of the rule type you select, you can select an <span class="Bold">Effective Date</span> and <span class="Bold">Expiration Date</span> to limit when the rule is valid. For example, a rule may apply only during a particular season.</p>
    <p>The <span class="Bold">Calculate Ship Unit Duration</span> determines if you need to calculate the ship unit dwell time/days.</p>
    <h2><a name="rule" id="rule"></a>Criteria</h2>
    <p>The fields in the Criteria section appear when Shipment or Shipment Group is selected as the rule type. What you enter here will limit the shipments or shipment groups to which the secondary charge rule applies.</p>

    <h2><a name="Contracts_for_Secondary_Charge" id="Contracts_for_Secondary_Charge"></a>Contracts for Secondary Charge</h2>
    <p>When you execute the Build Secondary Charge Shipments action, OTM searches for suitable secondary charge rules based on fields under the Criteria section on the Secondary Charge Rule page. If the selected secondary charge rule has an accessorial profile or a special service profile, OTM copies accessorials present in the accessorial profile or special services under a special service profile into the generated secondary charge shipments and then OTM rates the shipment accordingly. Each record will create one secondary charge shipment and is rated based on the rate record, rate offering, and service provider fields. If the fields are blank then the OTM rating engine rates the shipment using the least cost service provider available.</p>
    <p>In certain cases, services which need to be performed cannot be captured at the time of booking i.e. creating the order release, such services are discovered at the time of execution. For these additional services, the local office will have to setup a secondary charge rule with accessorial and special service profiles.</p>
    <p>You can create multiple secondary charge contracts in a secondary charge rule. Use this rule to create multiple secondary charge shipments on one freight shipment.</p>
    <p>To add multiple records of secondary charge contracts:</p>

      <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Rate Offering ID.</span></li>
      <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Rate Record ID</span>.</li>
