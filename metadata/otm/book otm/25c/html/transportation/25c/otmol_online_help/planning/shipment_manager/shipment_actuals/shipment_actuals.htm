  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Shipment Actuals</span></h1>
  <div role="main">
    <p>Sometimes the shipment is not as planned and you need to make edits to reflect what actually shipped. A change may be needed for either the quantity shipped, the equipment used or the stops made. This can be called shipment actuals or shipment modification (which is sometimes called SMD).</p>
    <p>Some of these edits can be made via the user interface or integration; some change can be made via integration only, modified via the XML.</p>
    <p>When a transaction code such as I/IU/U (non replacement, or &#39;R&#39;, transaction codes) is used on a parent object, for example a shipment, and an R based transaction code needs to be used on a child object, such as shipment stop, the supported &#39;R&#39; based transaction codes are R (Replace) and RP (ReplaceParent). RC (Replace Children) is not supported in this scenario.</p>
    <p>The <a href="../../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm#SMD_SYNC_WITH_ORDER">SMD SYNC WITH ORDER</a> parameter controls how an unplanned count in shipment actuals is handled. The default is true. When set to true, unplanned count of shipment ship unit will be created and associated with unplanned order movement.Â </p>
    <p>If you set the propagation and the parameterÂ <a href="../../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm#SMD_SYNC_WITH_ORDER">SMD SYNC WITH ORDER</a>Â to true,Â and the ship unit count is less than order&#39;s ship unit count, the system creates additional shipment ship units and order movements to hold the unplanned count. The system creates order movements for other legs, upstream and downstream, with the order&#39;s ship unit count.</p>
    <p>When ship unit count is equal or more than the order&#39;s ship unit count, the system creates order movements for other legs, upstream and downstream,Â with the specified ship unit count.</p>
    <p>If you set the propagation as Upstream, all the upstream legs will be syncedÂ with order. Likewise, if you set the propagation as Downstream, all theÂ downstream legs will be synced with order.<br>
      Â <br>
      New order movements are created based on the itinerary on the shipment and the propagation direction. Consider a scenario when you add a new orderÂ release to a shipment and the shipment is on a multi-leg itinerary, the new order release&#39;s source location or destination location is not on theÂ shipment. If the destination location of the order is not on the shipment andÂ the propagation is set as Downstream, new order movements are created from the shipment&#39;s destination location to the order&#39;s destination location. In caseÂ of multi-leg itinerary on the shipment, multiple order movements are createdÂ according to the subsequent legs of the shipment. If there is no itineraryÂ information on the shipment, one order movement is created from the shipment&#39;sÂ destination location to the order&#39;s destination location.Â <br>
      Â <br>
      Likewise, if the source location of the order is not on the shipment and theÂ propagation is set as Upstream, new order movements are created from the order&#39;sÂ source location to shipment&#39;s source location. In case of multi-leg itineraryÂ on the shipment, multiple order movements are created according to theÂ previous legs of the shipment. If there is no itinerary information on theÂ shipment, one order movement is created from the order&#39;s source location to the shipment&#39;s source location.<br>
      Â <br>
      When you remove an order release from a shipment, and if the planningÂ parameter <a href="../../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm#SMD_SYNC_WITH_ORDER">SMD SYNC WITH ORDER</a> is set to true, a new order movement is createdÂ for this removed order not only on the current leg (the leg shipment is on)Â to hold unplanned shipment ship units, but also propagates this behavior upÂ or down if propagation is set.Â <br>
      Â <br>
      This propagation of sync with order upstream or downstream does not work ifÂ there are legs sharing shipment equipment (SEquipment).</p>
    <p>OTM minimizes the total number of shipment ship units that remain when you apply a ship unit count reduction through shipment actual.Â </p>
    <h2><a name="shipment_stop" id="shipment_stop"></a>Shipment Stop</h2>
    <p>OTM only supports two use cases to modify stops through shipment actuals using integration. Changing the shipment stop can only be done via the XML. This cannot be done by an action. The two use cases are determined by the parameter <a href="../../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm#set_last_stop">Set Last Stop to 99</a>.</p>
    <h3>If the parameter is ON:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>First stop 1, last stop 99, is_permanent = Y</li>
      <li>Use IU to add new stops in the middle with stop number 2 to 98 with is_permanent = N</li>
      <li>Use RC to delete stops in the middle.</li>
      <li>Stop 1 and 99 can only be updated, not deleted regardless of using IU or RC.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>If the parameter is OFF (default):</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Make sure is_Permanent = N for all stops all the time.</li>
      <li>Use RC to add or delete stops or use I or D explicitly to insert or delete stops.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><a name="Edit_selection" id="Edit_selection"></a>Shipment Quantities - Edit Selection</h2>
    <p>Shipment quantities represent the actual packaged items that are received or shipped. Use the Shipment Quantities page to confirm or update the actual quantity, weight, and volume of the packaged items that are received on a shipment. After you update information on the page, OTM updates the shipment to reflect your changes.</p>
    <p>When changing quantities, the change can be specified through the order indirectly or through the shipment directly. Shipment actual only changes the shipment. It does not change the order even when the change was specified through the order.</p>
    <p>For details on editing actual shipment quantities, see <a href="edit_shipment_actuals.htm">Buy/Sell Shipment Quantities</a>.</p>
    <h2>Shipment Equipment</h2>
    <p>You can add, update (change) or delete equipment either through the UI or integration.</p>
    <p>Indexing shipment equipment is one use case modifying equipment through shipment actuals enabling you to tag the equipment</p>
    <h3>Via the UI</h3>
    <p>You can edit (add, update or delete) the shipment equipment via the shipment action <span class="Bold">Edit Quantities</span> or via XML. This action is accessed via <span class="Bold">Shipment Management &gt; Shipment Management &gt; Buy</span> <span class="Bold">or</span> <span class="Bold">Sell Shipments &gt; Actions &gt; Shipment Management &gt; Utilities &gt; Edit Quantities</span>.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: The option to add new equipment will only display on a subsequent page if the propagation option is set to None.</p>
    <h3>Via the Integration</h3>
    <p>Note the following limitation, when using ShipmentModViaOrderLine in the Actual Shipment Transmission weight, volume, or package count changes only apply to order configuration that is 1:1 or prepack (this limitation is not applicable to auto-calc).</p>
    <h4>RemoveOrderFromParallelShipmentsÂ IntCommand</h4>
    <p>The RemoveOrderFromParallelShipments IntCommand is used in integration XMLs when moving orders from one shipment to another. The command tells the system what to do with parallel, up, and downstream shipments.</p>
    <p>The IntCommandÂ is documented in the schema, which can be downloaded via <a href="../../../integration/retrieve_schema.htm">Retrieve Schemas</a>. Here is a sample XML that uses the IntCommand:</p>
    <p><span class="Code">&lt;otm:IntCommand&gt;<br>
        Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;otm:IntCommandName&gt;RemoveOrderFromParallelShipments&lt;/otm:IntCommandName&gt;<br>
        Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;otm:IntArg&gt;<br>
        Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;otm:ArgName&gt;Value&lt;/otm:ArgName&gt;<br>
        Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â &lt;otm:ArgValue&gt;TrueRetain&lt;/otm:ArgValue&gt;<br>
        Â  Â  Â  &lt;/otm:IntArg&gt;<br>
        &lt;/otm:IntCommand&gt;</span></p>
    <p>When the IntCommandName = &quot;RemoveOrderFromParallelShipments&quot;, the IntArg element supports the ArgName field &quot;Value&quot;. Then theÂ ArgValueÂ can be &quot;False&quot;, &quot;TrueRemove&quot;, or &quot;TrueRetain&quot; with a default value as &quot;False&quot;. The value of theÂ IntCommand is used when you add an order to a shipment using shipment actual.</p>
    <p>When theÂ value of IntCommandÂ is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&quot;TrueRemove&quot; or &quot;TrueRetain&quot;, the order will be removed from the parallel shipments of the actual shipment.</li>
      <li>&quot;TrueRemove&quot;, the order will be removedÂ from the up and/or downstream shipments according to the propagation flag.</li>
      <li>&quot;TrueRetain&quot;, the order will not be removed from the up or downstream shipments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If the IntCommandÂ valueÂ is &quot;TrueRetain&quot;, andÂ the order is split into multiple upstream or downstream shipments, only one upstream or downstream shipment of the split will be kept when propagation is set.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If the IntCommandÂ value is &quot;True&quot;, it will be interpreted as &quot;TrueRetain&quot; to be backwards compatible with 24C version.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>:Â TheÂ IntCommand does not support <a href="../../itinerary_manager/reuse_equipment.htm">re-</a><a href="../../itinerary_manager/reuse_equipment.htm">use equipment</a> configuration.</p>
