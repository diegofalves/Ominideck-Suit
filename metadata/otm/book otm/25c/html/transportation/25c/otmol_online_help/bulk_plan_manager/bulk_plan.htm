    </ul>
    <p>You can also access Bulk Plan from the Bulk Continuous Move, Bulk Plan Order Movements, and Bulk Plan Order Releases processes via <span class="Bold">Operational Planning &gt; Process Management</span>.</p>
    <p>You can bulk plan multiple orders into shipments to achieve optimal transportation solutions and consolidation opportunities. You can also initiate a bulk plan for orders entered through integration.</p>
    <p>When you perform a bulk plan, a unique ID is created for the plan and informational attributes are provided about the bulk plan results such as</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If a bulk plan is scheduled as a recurring job with a user-entered Bulk Plan ID, a time stamp is appended to the Bulk Plan ID each time it runs. This time stamp is the standard: YYYYMMDDHHmmss. This ensures the bulk plan ID is unique each time it runs. It also allows you to query for all runs of a particular requested bulk plan ID. By sorting on the Bulk Plan XID, descending, you can quickly see all runs, from latest to oldest.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start and end time of the bulk planning process</li>
      <li>Number of orders selected for bulk planning</li>
      <li>Number of orders that were planned on shipments</li>
      <li>Number of orders that were unassigned and re-planned for better shipping opportunities</li>
      <li>Number of shipments created</li>
      <li>Number of orders that failed to plan</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also set up Oracle Transportation Management to automatically review all shipments at the end of the bulk plan process to look for continuous move opportunities. This eliminates the need to manually create continuous moves. To have this process occur, you need to set the following <a href="../planning/power_data/planning/planning_parameters.htm">parameters</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>CM AUTO CREATE</li>
      <li>CM MODE</li>
      <li>CM MAX SEARCH DISTANCE</li>
      <li>CM MAX SEARCH DURATION</li>
      <li>CM MODE</li>
      <li>CM REDRIVE</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also specify what happens at the end of the bulk plan process when carrier/equipment capacity reaches its limit. To do this, set the following <a href="../planning/power_data/planning/planning_parameters.htm">parameters</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>CARRIER RESOURCE REASSIGNMENT TYPE</li>
      <li>MAX NUM REPLAN</li>
      <li>RERATE ALL SHIPMENTS AFTER BULK PLAN</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Results Tab</h2>
    <p>You can use the Bulk Plan Manager to review the results of any bulk plan, regardless of how you initiated it.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: You can access <a href="../asset_mgt/work_assignment_planning.htm">Work Assignment Planning</a> from Bulk Plan, when the <a href="../planning/power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm#FLEET_AWARE_BULK_PLAN">Fleet Aware Bulk Plan parameter</a> is set to true. This parameter will allow the creation of any work assignments in a bulk plan. For more information, see <a href="data_setup/fleet_and_bulk_planning.htm">Fleet and Bulk Planning</a>.</p>
    <p>The fields that display depend on whether you ran bulk plan against an order release or an order movement.</p>
