    <p>The required classifications on a trade transaction line/declaration line Â will be used to set product classification lookup statuses.</p>
    <p>When you run the <a href="../trade/actions/verify_classification_lookup.htm">Verify Classification</a> action, required product classification types will be populated in the Required Classification section depending on the service preference you configure.
