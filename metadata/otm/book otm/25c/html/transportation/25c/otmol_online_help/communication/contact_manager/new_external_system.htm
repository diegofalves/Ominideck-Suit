    <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">External System</span></h1>
    <div role="main">
      <p>This page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Business Process Automation &gt; Communication Management &gt; External Systems</span>.</p>
      <p>An external system is any remote system where you can store and/or use Oracle Transportation Management data. For example, you may want to send a copy of all orders to a remote directory where they can be viewed by others in your organization.</p>
      <p>Use the External System Manager to define the outside source where you want to forward records. The records are transmitted as XML documents starting with a &lt;Transmission&gt; tag, containing a header and a body. Most transmissions are sent out via HTTP POST, and an HTTP message is posted to the external system containing the transmission XML. However, you can also send out transmissions via email message. (To allow the external system to accept outbound transmissions via email, make sure the &quot; forwardingProtocol&quot; section of the external system URL is properly configured for email instead of HTTP.)</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: To be <a href="new_event_comm.htm">notified</a> if an HTTP POST fails, enter yourself as contact for the <a href="new_event_comm.htm">contact notification</a> for each domain that sends transmissions.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: The base structure of a transmission message is independent of the communication protocol.</p>
      <p>To export data, identify the external system, and then execute the action entitled <a href="../../general/send_intrfac_trans.htm">Send Interface Transmission</a> on the Results page containing the data you want to send. Alternatively, you can schedule transmissions from the <a href="../../planning/process_manager/process_manager/scheduling.htm">Process Manager</a>.</p>
      <p>For example, in the Process Manager you can schedule the transmission of shipment data based on the current status (or other criteria) of your shipments. It is common to receive thousands of orders, plan the orders on shipments, execute the shipments, tender the shipments, and then transmit the shipments to a downstream warehouse management system either on a regularly scheduled basis, automatically or on-demand, so that the necessary pick, pack, and ship activities can be executed. Using Send Integration, you can specify SHIPMENT as the integration interface; define a saved query to search the qualified data; specify the receiving external system by assigning URL and optional credentials to integrate with the receiving system; schedule when the interfaces should be transmitted, and how the transmission should be interpreted.</p>
      <h2>Test Your External System</h2>
      <p>If you want to test your new external system, most managers contain a <a href="../../general/send_intrfac_trans.htm">Send Interface Transmission</a> action. You can also send transmissions in the <a href="../../planning/process_manager/process_manager/misc/send_integration.htm">Process Manager</a>. See each integration interface for a description of how that interface can be sent.</p>
      <h3>Errors</h3>
      <p>If your external system does not receive your transmission, verify that your external system is running and then search for your transmission in the <a href="../../integration/transmission_manager.htm">transmission manager</a>.</p>
      <h3>Health Check</h3>
      <p>You can run theÂ <a href="../../planning/process_manager/process_manager/misc/external_system_health_check.htm">External System Health Check</a>Â and get notified if there are errors with your external systems.</p>
      <h2><a name="External" id="External"></a>External System</h2>
      <p>Before you can send data to an external system, you must define where to send the data.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">External System ID</span> uniquely identifies your system.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Description</span> contains a brief summary of the external system.</li>
        <li>Enter an <a href="../../planning/power_data/25_general/integration_preference.htm"><span class="Bold">Integration Preference ID</span></a>. Outbound XML sent to this external system will have UOM data as per the settings in this integration preference.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Use Credential</span> indicates that the user name in the outbound integration should be the Oracle Transportation Management requesting user ID. So if you are logged in as GUEST.ADMIN and you initiate an outbound integration through the Send Integration action, the username for the transmission authentication would be specified as GUEST.ADMIN. For security reasons, the password is not specified from the user requesting the action.</li>
        <li>Enter <span class="Bold">User Name</span> and <span class="Bold">Password</span> if your external system requires authentication or is behind a firewall that requires authentication. User name and password are sent in the HTTP header.</li>
        <li>All transmissions before 6.4.2 either did not use a namespace, or if present, contained one or both of the following URLs: &quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/apps/otm&quot; or &quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/apps/gtm&quot;. In 6.4.2 this URL has changed to identify the new version and is &quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/apps/otm/transmission/v6.4&quot; or &quot;http://xmlns.oracle.com/apps/gtm/transmission/v6.4,&quot; respectively. Use the <span class="Bold">Target Namespace</span> field to choose the XML format for outbound transmissions. The options are:
          <ul>
            <li><span class="Bold">Current</span>: All XML messages will use the 6.4.2 namespace URL version.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Versions prior to 6.4.2</span>: Uses the namespace URLs for previous versions.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">None</span>: Use the 6.4.2 Transmission XML with the namespace URLs stripped from the result.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">None (Compatibility Mode)</span>: Use the pre-6.4.2 Transmission XML version with namespace URLs stripped.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Enter a <span class="Bold">Content Type</span>Â to select the media type (format) of the outbound data. For example, &quot;text/xml&quot; or &quot;application/xml&quot; are used to produce XML format messages, and &quot;application/json&quot; should be used for JSON messages. Enter the value which corresponds with the integration service you have selected.</li>
        <li>Select a <span class="Bold">Domain Name</span>.</li>
        <li>Select an <span class="Bold">Active Mode</span> from the drop-down list. You can use the active mode to enable/disable sending to the external system. You can choose from the following options:
          <ul>
            <li><span class="Bold">Enabled</span>: your system will generate and send XML.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Build XML, Disable Send</span>: The XML is generated and stored but is not sent.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Disabled, Log Entry</span>: Logs an entry in the i_transmission and i_transaction tables without generating XML.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Disabled</span>: The system will not log entries, generate XML or send any information to the external system.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Enable Debug</span> checkbox to enable debugging for the external system. The log messages are stored in the i_log table and are available as part of the transmission report.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Log Response</span> checkbox if you want to capture responses sent by the external system in the transmission log.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Reattempt Mode</span> from the drop-down list. The reattempt mode defines the system reattempts to send to the external system. You can choose from the following options:
          <ul>
            <li><span class="Bold">None - ERROR Status</span>: No reattempts are made. The status of the transmission is set to ERROR when an error occurs.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Use Redo Processing</span>: The status of the transmission is set to REDO when an error occurs and the REDO transmission processing will manage a resend.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Use Time Delay</span>: The <span class="Bold">Reattempts Delay</span> field indicates how long to wait before again attempting to resend information.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Specify the maximum number of attempts to send the transmission to the external system in the <span class="Bold">Max Reattempts</span> field.</li>
        <li>If the <span class="Bold">Transport Through Data Stream</span> checkbox is selected (default), the XML is loaded before sending out and transporting through data stream.</li>
        <li>In the <span class="Bold">Reattempts Delay</span> field, enter the amount of time to wait before another attempt to send is made. This field is used if the <span class="Bold">Reattempt Mode</span> is set to Use Time Delay.</li>
        <li>In the <span class="Bold">Reattempt Deadline</span> field, enter the maximum time from when the transmission is created that an attempt is made to send the transmission. This field is used if the <span class="Bold">Reattempt Mode</span> is set to Use Time Delay.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Max Bytes Per Trans</span> and <span class="Bold">Max Transaction Per Trans:</span> The external system may only allow transmissions of a certain maximum size. Consult the documentation provided with the external system to determine any limits on transmission size.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Socket Timeout</span> is the timeout for the network/socket connection for communication. You can set the property &quot;<a href="../../properties/glog/socket.property.htm#glog.socket.timeout">glog.socket.timeout</a>&quot; to define how long the system will wait for a response when pinging a server. The default is 5 seconds.</li>
        <li><a id="authentication_type"></a>The <span class="Bold">Authentication Type</span> describes the authentication and authorization protocol to be used for HTTP/HTTPS communication. Your choice here directly affect the sections and fields that are available on the page in the <a href="new_external_system.htm#http">Authentication Types</a>Â section. If no value is selected but there are values for Username and Password, then this is equivalent to HTTP Authentication (Basic). Options are:</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>HTTP Authentication (Basic)</li>
        <li>Pre-Authenticated Request</li>
        <li>OAuth 2.0 - Client Credentials</li>
        <li>OAuth 2.0 - Password Grant</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a name="http" id="http"></a>Authentication Types</h2>
      <p>HTTP Authentication (Basic) is defined by <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2617" target="_blank" title="RFC 2617: HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication">RFC2617</a> and relates to the &quot;Authorization: Basic &lt;encoded credentials&gt;&quot; HTTP header. Depending the Authentication Type selected, the information entered in this section varies.</p>
      <h3>HTTP Authentication (Basic)</h3>
      <p>When you select HTTP Authentication (Basic) as the authentication type, use the following fields.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="Bold">URL</span>: Specify URLs with both HTTP or HTTPS in this field. Depending on how you want to send your data, enter one of the following:
          <ul>
            <li>HTTP POST: URL of the system you want to send the data to.</li>
            <li>Username</li>
            <li>Password</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Read Response Code</span> checkbox if you want the HTTP response code to be validated.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: On some JVMs, data may not be sent unless this checkbox is selected.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Trans Acknowledgement Expected</span> checkbox if you expect the transaction acknowledgement to be received when sending via synchronous protocol.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Use Acknowledgement Status</span> checkbox specifies if the transmission acknowledgement status should be used as the status of the transmission.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Close HTTP Connection</span> checkbox to close the HTTP connection after interacting with the external system.</li>
        <li>Enter an <span class="Bold"><a href="../../planning/power_data/25_general/http_profile.htm">HTTP Profile ID</a></span> to define a connection to an EBS instance.</li>
        <li>Enter an <span class="Bold"><a href="../../planning/power_data/workflow/profile_stylesheet.htm">Acknowledgement Stylesheet Profile ID</a></span>.</li>
        <li>Enter an <span class="Bold">HTTP Header Profile ID</span>. The HTTP Header Profile is used to define additional HTTP header parameters to be sent on outbound HTTP messages. Only supported by the REST communication method.</li>
        <li>Select an <span class="Bold">HTTP Method</span>. This is used to declare the HTTP method specified in the outbound message. Only supported by the REST communication method. Defaults to POST.</li>
        <li>If the method selected in the HTTP Method field is PATCH and you select the <span class="Bold">Use HTTP Post Override</span> checkbox, then the actual HTTP method sent in the message is POST and the X-HTTP-Method-Override HTTP header is sent with the value PATCH. Only supported by the REST communication method.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Select the <span class="Bold">Allow Follow Redirect </span>checkbox to let the External System follow redirectÂ responses.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3><a id="Pre-Authenticated_URL"></a>Pre-Authenticated Request</h3>
      <p>When you select the Pre-Authenticated Request authentication type, the Pre-Authenticated URL field is visible.</p>
      <p>Enter the <span class="Bold">Pre-Authenticated URL</span>. This URL is only visible when you initially create the external system. If you edit the external system, you only see asterisks and cannot change the URL.</p>
      <p>Pre-authenticatedÂ URL provides a way to let users access an object without having their own credentials, as long as the request creator has permissions to access those objects. Only use this option if you receive the pre authenticated URL from the source whose data you need to access. For example, <a href="../../machine_learning/machine_learning_overview.htm">Logistics Machine Learning</a> uses a pre authenticated URL to allow customers to save objects to an OCI object store.</p>
      <h3><a id="OAuth_._-_Client_Credentials"></a>OAuth 2.0 - Client Credentials</h3>
      <p>The OAuth 2.0 - Client Credentials flow is a two step protocol used to support token based access to resources on a resource server. The first step authenticates with an authorization service to obtain a token and the second step sends this token to the resource server to access resources. Typically, a one time administrative step will have been performed to configure access for one application to another. The details required and the properties used for subsequent access depend on the physical implementation of the authorization service but will typically include, but not be limited to, some kind of unique client ID and secret.</p>
      <p>When you select OAuth 2.0 - Client Credentials as the authentication type, the following fields are available:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select an <span class="Bold">Authorization Service Authentication Type</span>. The option you choose determines what fields are available in this section. Different authorization servers can use different authentication methods. This is the method used to request authorization from authorization service on behalf of the client.
          <ol>
            <li>If you select the <span class="Bold">HERE OAuth 1.0 Signature</span> option, the following fields are available:
              <ul>
                <li><span class="Bold">Consumer Key</span>: This is the key required by authentication service authentication type. This is provided by HERE.</li>
                <li>The <span class="Bold">Consumer Secret</span>: This is the secret required by authentication service authentication type.Â This is provided by HERE.</li>
                <li>The <span class="Bold">Signature Hashing Algorithm</span>: This is the algorithm used to sign the message if required by the authentication type.</li>
              </ul>

      <ol>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Hostname</span> of the FTP server you want to send to.</li>
        <li>Enter a <span class="Bold">Port</span>. When sending out FTP/FTPS messages, they are sent using the supplied port. If the port is left blank, it is based on the default port for the protocol.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Remote Directory</span> refers only to FTP. Enter the directory you want to access on the remote FTP server. Make sure the remote directory exists on the remote FTP server, otherwise the transmission fails.
          <br>
          <br>
          The Remote Directory can be either an absolute path which the remote FTP server finds from its root directory or a relative path which the FTP server finds relative to the home directory of the FTP user. It is often better to use a relative path since the FTP user may not have access to the root. </li>
        <li>Select whether the <span class="Bold">Connection Mode</span> should be active or passive. If it is set to Active, then the system opens an active FTP connection to the external system.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Use FTP Append</span> checkbox if you want the FTP protocol to use the append file mode to send the data to the FTP server in batches, or should use the &quot;put&quot; mode where the whole transmission is sent at once.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Use Secure FTP</span> checkbox if you want your FTP transactions to be secure. PROT P encryption for SSL file transfers is not supported. The FTP server cannot enforce PROT P.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="Web" id="Web"></a>Web Service</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Trans Acknowledgement Expected</span> checkbox if you expect the transaction acknowledgement to be received when sending via synchronous protocol.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Use Acknowledgement Status</span> checkbox specifies if the transmission acknowledgement status should be used as the status of the transmission.</li>
        <li>If you want to communicate application to application, enter a <a href="../../web_service_manager/web_service_manager.htm"><span class="Bold">web service</span></a>.</li>
        <li>Select a <span class="Bold">service operation</span> from the drop-down list. Service operations are defined in the WSDL for the web service.</li>
        <li>If the service endpoint is not identified in the WSDL, enter it in the <span class="Bold">Service Endpoint</span> field. The service endpoint is the machine and the URL. For example, http://c<span class="Code">&lt; hostname_of_OTM_server&gt;</span>:7001/GC3Service/ WMService/call.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="extsystem" id="extsystem"></a>External System Translations</h2>
      <p>Use the Integration Translations section, if you want Oracle Transportation Management to transform outbound XML transmissions with XSL. XSL enables you to change from one XML format to another. You can also change from an XML format to a flat file.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="Bold">Sequence Number:</span> If you need to apply multiple transformations to a transmission, Oracle Transportation Management applies the stylesheets in the order you specify here.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">XML Element ID</span> determines which GLogXMLElement the XSL stylesheet applies to.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Use the Upload an XML/CSV Transmission page in Integration Manager to <a href="../../integration/upload_xml_trans.htm">upload</a> the XSL files you need for integration translations.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Enter a <span class="Bold"><a href="../../planning/power_data/workflow/profile_stylesheet.htm">Stylesheet Profile ID</a></span>. The <a href="../../planning/power_data/workflow/stylesheet_content.htm">stylesheet content</a> present on the stylesheet profile is used for formatting of the outbound XML message.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Stylesheet Name</span> is the name of the specific XSL stylesheet that transforms the transmissions.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Add XML Declaration</span> checkbox if an xml declaration should be added to the final output XML element. This field is used when staging outbound integration and applying XSL to what is staged. When staging, transactions are stored one at a time and the XSL is applied when storing the transaction. When staging, the individual transactions are later concatenated to produce the full XML.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Root Element Name</span> field indicates what the root element of the XML document should be. This field is also used when staging outbound integration.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="Bold">Save</span> for each sequence you define.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="xml" id="xml"></a>Out XML Profiles</h2>
      <p>By assigning an Out XML Profile ID to a specific XML Element, you can exclude specific portions XML from your outbound messages.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>In the <a href="../../planning/power_data/25_general/output_xml_profiles.htm"><span class="Bold">Out XML Profile ID</span></a> field, select the profile that contains the exclusions to apply to the Element you just selected.</li>
        <li>In the <span class="Bold"><a href="../../planning/power_data/25_general/xml_element.htm">XML Element</a></span> field, select the XML element that you want the exclusion to apply to.</li>
        <li>Enter a <span class="Bold">Priority</span> for the Out XML Profile to give processing precedence to certain transaction type. For example, you may want to send all Releases before sending PlannedShipments.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="Bold">Save</span>. Repeat if there are multiple exclusions you want to apply to this external system.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Out JSON Profiles</h2>
      <p>By assigning an <a href="../../planning/power_data/25_general/out_json_profiles.htm">Out JSON Profile</a> ID to a specific XML Element, you canÂ filter and select appropriate fields and child resources for REST-JSON-based outbound external interface transmissions. This allows you to control the list of elements you want to send in the REST outbound external interface transmission.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>In the <span class="Bold">ResourceÂ IDÂ </span>field, select the REST resource you&#39;d like to include.</li>
        <li>In theÂ <span class="Bold"><a href="../../planning/power_data/25_general/out_json_profiles.htm">Out JSON Profile ID</a></span>Â Â field, select the profile that contains the level of resource content that will be returned when REST resources are accessed.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="Bold">Save</span>. Repeat for other resources as needed.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="Bold">Finished</span>.</li>
      </ol>
