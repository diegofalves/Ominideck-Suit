    <div role="main">
      <p>This page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Contract and Rate Management &gt; Contract Management &gt; Rate Record</span>.</p>
      <p>The Rate Manager allows you to manage rates for inbound and outbound goods for all transportation modes, including truckload and less-than-truckload, vessels, rail and air. A rate is considered a contract between the user and a service provider or a user and their clients. The Rate Manager stores information about effective and expiration dates, freight limitations, accessorials, and the rates themselves. Rates can be defined or limited by weight, volume, distance and commodity. In addition, a rate can model most industry practices such as deficit ratings, base and excess discounts, minimums and surcharges.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Alternatively, you may choose to enter rates automatically via integration. See the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=otm-latest&amp;id=OTMIT" target="_blank" title="Integration Guide">Integration Guide</a> on the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=otm-latest&amp;id=otm-gs" target="_blank" title="Oracle Help Center">Oracle Help Center</a>.</p>
      <p>One or more rate records can be associated with a single rate offering. While the offering provides general contractual details, the record defines a cost for service between one location and another. A record relies on an associated rate offering for much of its information but can override some of the data in the offering, if necessary.</p>
      <p>After you define a rate offering or record, you can use the data when qualifying an order. Once pickup and destination locations are provided, an itinerary is chosen and the order is released, the shipment is matched with one or more qualifying rates. Rates qualify when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rate constraints for weight, length and other units are met for the order and the itinerary.</li>
        <li>Time constraints for the order are met.</li>
        <li>Optional constraints, such as those requiring special equipment or services, are met.</li>
        <li>Geographical requirements are met.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a name="Rate_record" id="Rate_record"></a>Rate Record</h2>
      <p>Rate Records can only be created based on a rate offering. While the rate offering provides general contract details from a service provider, a rate record provides specific costing or rating data from one place to another. The record inherits much of its data from the offering but the options selected in the offering can be overridden at the record level. Â </p>
      <p>To create a rate record, first select the rate offering on which the record is to be based, and enter details for the record.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Alternatively, you may enter rates automatically via integration. See the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=otm-latest&amp;id=OTMIT" target="_blank" title="Integration Guide">Integration Guide</a> on the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=otm-latest&amp;id=otm-gs" target="_blank" title="Oracle Help Center">Oracle Help Center</a>.</p>
      <p>Creating a rate record using the Rate Manager consists of the following steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="Bold">Select a Rate Offering</span> on the Search page to find a <a href="create_rate_offering.htm">rate offering</a> to use as the basis for the record. Â </li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Lane Info</span> identifies how the source and destination points are defined for the rate.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Attributes</span> define the actual geographical points for which the rate is applicable as well as any <a href="rate_record_attributes.htm">attributes</a> that may differ from those defined in the rate offering.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="rate_costs.htm">Rate Costs</a></span> identify how the cost of shipping is calculated, including information about ship units, equipment groups and actual rates.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="accessorials.htm">Accessorials</a></span> outline any extra charges that may be applied.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="special_services.htm">Special Services</a></span> define any extra services that may be offered.</li>
        <li><a href="../../general/remarks.htm"><span class="Bold">Remarks</span></a> allows you to add any remarks that are needed.</li>
        <li><a href="flex_attributes.htm"><span class="Bold">Flex Attributes</span></a> allows you to show all the flex attributes configured as part of the properties defined on the custom property sets.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Information entered in a rate record may override settings established in the associated rate offering.</p>
      <p>When the Search rate offering page appears, <a href="../../general/search_gc3.htm">search</a> for the offering. When the Results page appears, select the rate offering and click <span class="Bold">Edit</span>.</p>
      <h2><a name="sourcingrates" id="sourcingrates"></a>Oracle Transportation Sourcing Rate Records</h2>
      <p>You can use the Oracle Transportation Management rating structure for Oracle Transportation Sourcing. A rate is considered an Oracle Transportation Sourcing rate if you select the <a href="create_rate_offering.htm#sourcingtemplate">Sourcing Template</a> checkbox on the rate offering.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: When creating an Oracle Transportation Sourcing rate offering, you should only associate a single rate record with that rate offering. A rate offering is an Oracle Transportation Sourcing rate if you select the <a href="create_rate_offering.htm#sourcingtemplate">Sourcing Template</a> checkbox on the rate offering.</p>
      <p>Also, when creating your rate costs you can only use a <a href="sourcing_rate_basis_items.htm">sub-set</a> of the standard Oracle Transportation Management rate costs.</p>
      <p>You can use Oracle Transportation Management rating to set up base costs, stop-off charges, accessorials, special services, and LTL weight break discounts. For cost definition, you can select the cost types of charge and discount. The external cost type is by definition not biddable and the cost type of profile is not supported by Oracle Transportation Sourcing.</p>
      <p>Once a rate record (<a href="../../field_definitions/rate_record_template.htm">rate record template</a>) is attached to a <a href="../../procurement/crt_configuration/crt_configuration.htm">CRT Configuration</a>, you cannot edit either the rate offering or rate record. The rate information is pulled from the rate record template upon creation of the CRT configuration and this information will not be updated if the rate record is changed. To avoid the loss of data, the rate record offering and rate record are both locked when the CRT configuration is created.</p>
      <p>Rate records based on rate offerings marked as <a href="create_rate_offering.htm#sourcingtemplate">sourcing templates</a> or <a href="create_rate_offering.htm#sourcingrate">read only</a> will not be used by Oracle Transportation Management for shipment building or execution.</p>
      <h2><a name="Finder" id="Finder"></a>Using the Rate Record Finder</h2>
      <p>When using the Item Classification field for filtering, only one classification field criteria should be specified, because each rate record is linked to one particular type of flex commodity qualifier. For example, if you specified HTS ID criteria as HT-001 - BEGINS WITH and NMFC Class ID criteria as 100 BEGINS, the finder will not find any results. You should either specify Commodity ID, NMFC Article ID, SITC ID, STCC ID, HTS ID, NMFC or User Defined Commodity ID.</p>
      <p>In Oracle Transportation Management, there is a general concept of profile that can be defined on different business objects like service provider, equipment group etc. This concept of profile helps you to identify and define groups of business entities/objects that have something in common. As part of this profile definition, it is possible to include or exclude common business entities. The concept of include or exclude (managed via compatibility attribute) is not honored/checked for the Equipment Group ID profile and Flex Commodity profile based filtering attributes.</p>
      <h2><a name="Rate_Record_Header" id="Rate_Record_Header"></a>Rate Record Header</h2>
      <p>The Header section contains general information about the rate record.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Rate records marked as read only rates will ONLY be used for Rate Maintenance. They will not be used by Oracle Transportation Management for shipment building or execution.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="Bold">Rate Record ID:</span> Enter an identifier to uniquely identify this Rate Record or leave it blank to have Oracle Transportation Management automatically generate an ID when you save the record.</li>
        <li>Enter a <span class="Bold">Domain Profile ID</span> in the field if you want to specify a <a href="../power_data/25_general/domain_profile.htm">domain profile</a> as a constraint on the rate record.</li>
        <li>If your rate record is only valid for a particular period of time, specify the rate record&#39;s <span class="Bold">Effective Date</span> and <span class="Bold">Expiration Date</span>. Effective Date should be less than shipment start date and Expiration Date should be greater than shipment start date or null. If the shipment falls outside the date range, the rate record is invalid, and a different rate record may apply. For example, if the Effective Date is 12/01/2024 and the Expiration Date is 12/31/2024, the rate will not be used if the shipment start date is before 12/01/2024 or after 12/31/2024.

For example, if you indicate that this rate record is valid from USZIP3 to USZIP3, the next page asks for the actual 3-digit zip codes. However, if you indicate that the rate record is valid if it starts and ends in a particular city, the next page asks for the actual cities.</p>

      <p>In addition to using a Geo Hierarchy, you can define the lane using <a href="../power_data/geography/regions.htm">regions</a>. Search for a user-defined region in the <span class="Bold">Source</span> and/or <span class="Bold">Destination Region</span> fields, and attach it to this rate record.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If you selected Parcel as your rate offering Transport Mode or Zone-Based as your rate offering type, select a Rate Zone instead of a Geo Hierarchy.</p>
      <p>The above hierarchies are used to determine the rate records based on the source and destination addresses of the shipment.</p>
      <p>The searching of the rate records can be of three types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="Bold">By location</span> - When the source and destination locations are the same, then the rate records are searched using the location ID.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">By lane</span> - The rate records are searched based on the matching geo hierarchies of source and destination addresses with that of the lanes defined for the rate record.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">By zone</span> - The rate records are searched based on the matching geo hierarchies of source and destination addresses with that of the lanes defined for the zone profile specified on the rate record.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For source and destination location pairs, you can determine the possible geo hierarchies and search the rate records based on them.</p>
      <p>For example, If the source location is PPA (PAMPA) and the destination location is
        <br>
        USOAK (OAKLAND), the hierarchical names are derived as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For PPA, hierarchical names are derived as &#39;COUNTRY\USA\&#39;, &#39;STATE/PROVINCE\TX\&#39;, &#39;CITY\PAMPA\TX\USA\&#39;, &#39;CITY/COUNTRY\PAMPA\USA\&#39;, &#39;LOCATION\PPA\&#39;</li>
        <li>For USOAK, hierarchical names are derived as Â &#39;COUNTRY\USA\&#39;, &#39;STATE/PROVINCE\CA\&#39;, &#39;USZIP3\946\&#39;, &#39;CITY\OAKLAND\CA\USA\&#39;, &#39;CITY/COUNTRY\OAKLAND\USA\&#39;, &#39;USZIP5\94604\&#39;, &#39;POSTAL_CODE\94604-2064\&#39;, &#39;LOCATION\USOAK\&#39;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The above geo hierarchies are matched with the geo hierarchies of the lane or the lanes of the zone profile defined for the rate record.</p>
      <p>The rate record with the most specific geo hierarchy is selected based on the ranking of the geo hierarchy. The ranks for each Geographic hierarchy are specified in the Geography Hierarchy Manager. For example, the following are the ranks defined for few geo hierarchies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>LOCATION - 1</li>
        <li>CITY/COUNTRY - 3</li>
        <li>STATE/PROVINCE - 5</li>
        <li>COUNTRY - 10</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The rank for the rate record is determined using the geo hierarchies of the source and destination addresses using the below formula:</p>
      <p>when the destination address rank is less than or equal to the source address rank, then the rank of the rate record is calculated as (source address rank + destination address rank)*2 otherwise it is calculated as (source address rank + destination address rank)*2 + 1.</p>
      <p>Often, there can be multiple rate records with the same rank and these rate records are further filtered out using the planning parameter &quot;ALLOW DUPLICATE RATES BY CARRIER&quot;.</p>
      <h2><a name="via" id="via"></a>VIA Locations</h2>
      <p><span class="Bold">VIA Locations</span> are used when rating and routing international shipments. Rates are valid when the data specified here matches the VIA Locations set up on an <a href="../../field_definitions/via_locations.htm">itinerary</a>.</p>
      <p>VIA Locations refer to ports that the shipment must pass through. For example, if an itinerary is set up as Pittsburgh for the source and London as the destination, then New York could be set up as the VIA Source Location because the shipment would go from Pittsburgh to London via New York. In this case, a matching rate record must be set up with New York as the VIA Source Location.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: When using a source or destination via point (port of load or port of discharge) on the shipment, you cannot use a rate record that has a source or destination via point that does not match.</p>
      <p>Multiple VIA Source and VIA Destination Locations can be set up on the same rate record. In this case, you would set up a profile that would list the possible VIA locations. The VIA Source Location ID field should not be used when a VIA Source Location Profile is used. The same is true for the VIA Destination Location ID field. The planning logic will not read the profile field when location field is populated, narrowing the valid VIA locations to the one in the VIA Location ID field.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>VIA Source Location ID: Used when only a single VIA Source Location is valid.</li>
        <li>VIA Source Location Profile ID: Used when a list of valid source VIA locations are valid.</li>
        <li>VIA Dest Location ID: Used when only a single VIA Destination Location is valid.</li>
        <li>VIA Dest Location Profile ID: Used when a list of valid destination VIA locations are valid.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>VIA Points as Shipment Stops</h3>
      <p>If you set the parameterÂ <a href="../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm#add_rate_via_points_as_stops">ADD RATE VIA POINTS AS STOPS</a> to true, the application adds the Port of Load and the Port of Discharge from the rate record as stops to a shipment,Â provided adding these VIA points do not make the shipment time infeasible.</p>
      <p>VIA points can be added as shipment stops only if the following conditions are satisfied:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>It is not a multi-leg scenario.</li>
        <li>The <a href="rate_service_attributes.htm">rate service</a> must be of type &quot;LOOKUP&quot;.</li>
        <li>If there are multiple port of load/port of discharge defined on the rate record, the first alphabetic ones are picked to be added as stops.</li>
        <li>If the order has a port of load/port of discharge already constrained, then that must be considered.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note:Â </span>Not only source-destination, but also other necessary entries (like source-port of load, port of load-port of discharge, and port of discharge-destination) are required for the shipment to consider this rate.</p>
