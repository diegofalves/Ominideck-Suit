      <ul>
        <li><span class="Bold">Order Management &gt; Purchase Order &gt; Order Base</span>. Click the <span class="Bold">Constraints</span> tab.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Order Management &gt; Order Release &gt; Order Release</span>. Click the <span class="Bold">Constraints</span> tab.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Most of the fields are the same on the order base and the order release. Any fields that are different between the two will be noted as such on a per-field basis.</p>
      <p>Oracle Transportation Management provides a variety of constraints that you can place on an order (order-level constraints) or itinerary leg (leg-level) that help you control how orders are bundled and how shipments are created for orders. For example, these constraints let you determine which service provider is used, control the transportation mode, dictate that cost of shipping an order by choosing a specific rate, and determine whether orders should be planned through cross-docks or distribution pools.</p>
      <p>If you decide not to use these constraints (itinerary, rate, and service provider), Oracle Transportation Management&#39;s optimization engine determines the best choice during the shipment planning process.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Order-level constraints only impact the planning of the primary leg. Leg-level constraints can be used to influence the planning of any other itinerary leg.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If you decide to use the constraints for rate offerings and itineraries, these entries override the &quot;Active&quot; state of those business objects as well as any effective or expiration dates that have been recorded for the business object. For example, if you specify a rate offering that is marked as inactive in the Rate Manager, Oracle Transportation Management will assign the Rate Offering that you specify regardless of the fact that it is marked inactive. The assumption is that these constraints always take precedence.</p>
      <h2>Adding Constraints</h2>
      <ol>

        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="../power_data/service_provider/service_provider_profile.htm">Buy Service Provider Profile</a></span> field only considers a set of service providers included in the profile when building shipments (as opposed to specifying a single service provider discussed in the previous paragraph).
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If you use either one of these service provider constraints, you must have at least one <a href="../rate_manager/create_rate_offering.htm">rate offering</a> for the service provider to successfully build a shipment from the order.</p>
        </li>

        <li>The <a href="../rate_manager/create_rate_service.htm"><span class="Bold">Rate Service ID</span></a> field identifies a specific rate service that is used when building a shipment for the order.</li>
        <li>The <a href="../power_data/rates_and_codes/rate_service_profiles.htm"><span class="Bold">Rate Service Profile</span></a> sets up a list of rate service types. Only rates that have the service levels identified in that profile are used during the shipment planning process.

        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="../../field_definitions/date_emphasis.htm">Date Emphasis</a></span> governs how the order release Early/Late Pickup Dates and Early/Late Delivery Dates are used. It takes into account some parameter settings.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Ignore Location Calendar</span> checkbox will cause the system to ignore the constraints set by the location&#39;s calendar.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold"><a href="../power_data/rates_and_codes/allocation_group.htm">Allocation Group ID</a></span> field allows you to constrain by allocation group.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Must Ship Thru Cross Dock</span> is a process where product is received in a facility, occasionally married with other products going to the same destination, then shipped at the earliest opportunity without going into long-term storage.
          <br>
          <br>
          If checked, any order release that is created from this order base must ship through a cross-dock. You can only use this constraint if you create itineraries that support <a href="../../configuration/creat_cross_docks.htm">cross-dock planning</a>. </li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Must Ship Thru Pool</span> is a process of freight consolidation when customers have multiple orders going to the same consignee, each with a different purchase order. It can also involve the shipment of multiple orders on a single truckload to a distribution center and then subsequent deliveries within those geographic territories. This allows customers to gain freight savings by having only one truckload rate and the local drayage versus multiple LTL shipments.
          <br>
          <br>
          If checked, any order release that is created from this order base must ship through a distribution pool. You can only use this constraint if you create an itinerary that supports distribution pool planning.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Orders must be planned using the Bulk Plan action to be considered for this type of consolidation.</p>
        </li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Must Ship Direct</span> is the traditional transportation method when no cross-dock or distribution pool is needed. If checked, order releases created from this order base must ship direct or multi-stop from the source location to the destination location. If you have not configured an itinerary to support cross-dock or distribution pool planning, Oracle Transportation Management automatically assumes this planning constraint.</li>
        <li>Select a <a href="../../field_definitions/bundling_type.htm"><span class="Bold">Bundling Type</span></a> from the drop-down list. If you select &quot;Do Not Bundle&quot;, it will prevent orders that would naturally bundle together from being built on to the same shipment. Use the Do Not Bundle option only if you need to explicitly prevent orders that would naturally bundle together from being on the same shipment. This will impact multi-stop shipments.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If you are working with an order release for a multi-stop shipment, the <span class="Bold">Bundling Type</span> field will be read only and will be set to Do Not Bundle.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The <a href="../itinerary_manager/routing_constraint_manager.htm"><span class="Bold">Routing Constraint ID</span></a> identifies routing constraints that apply to this order release.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold"><a href="../../field_definitions/allow_equipment_consolidation.htm">Allow Equipment Consolidation</a></span> checkbox determines how order release equipment is handled during bundling and allows order releases which have equipment specified to be bundled together.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a name="ship_with_group" id="ship_with_group"></a>Ship With Group:</span> For non-multistop functionality, this acts as an order planning constraint to prevent orders in a given bulk plan with non-identical Ship with Group values from bundling into shipments. A value of &quot;null&quot; (default) will bundle with all other orders with a value of &quot;null&quot; but will not be considered a bundling candidate for an order with the Ship with Group field populated with any value. Similarly, multiple orders in the same bulk plan with identical Ship with Group values will be considered candidates for consolidation, while other orders in that same bulk plan with different Ship with Group values will not.
          <br>
          <br>
          For multi-stop scenarios, the Ship with Group functionality can be influenced by the MULTISTOP CONSOLIDATION logic parameter <a href="../power_data/planning/logic_configuration_multistop.htm#multistopfavor">MULTISTOP FAVOR SAME SHIP WITH GROUP</a>. In addition, the <a href="../power_data/planning/logic_configuration_multistop.htm#multistop_same_shipwithgroup_emp">MULTISTOP SAME SHIP WITH GROUP EMPHASIS</a> logic configuration parameter is used to further incent the multi-stop logic to consolidate orders with the same Ship with Group value. Also see the property â<a href="../../properties/glog/business.property.htm#consolidation.bulkplan.favorSameSWGConsolidation">glog.business.consolidation.bulkplan.favorSameSWGConsolidation</a>â. </li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Pickup Rail Carrier</span> and <span class="Bold">Delivery Rail Carrier</span>: (located on the Order Release Manager Constraints tab only). In some cases, the least cost rate is not desirable for service related issues. This provides the ability to assign delivery and pickup rail carrier on an order to apply constraint.</li>
        <li>If you wish to constrain the order based on a rail route, use the <span class="Bold"><a href="../power_data/rates_and_codes/rail_route_codes.htm">Rail Route Code</a></span> field to record the code to be used.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a name="routing_sequence" id="routing_sequence"></a>Pickup Routing Sequence</span> and <span class="Bold">Drop off Routing Sequence</span> control the <a href="../power_data/planning/routing_sequence.htm">routing sequence</a>; how Oracle Transportation Management plans the sequence of shipment stops that are built from an order base.</li>
        <li>Once a release order is planned and a shipment is successfully created, Oracle Transportation Management completes the <span class="Bold">Buy/Sell Assigned Itinerary</span> fields with the ID of the itinerary that was used. You can view the details of the itinerary using the <a href="../itinerary_manager/itinerary_parameters.htm">Itinerary Manager</a>.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Leg Consolidation Group ID</span> constrains by <a href="../power_data/25_general/leg_consolidation_group.htm">leg consolidation group</a>.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Early Sail Date</span>: The early sailing date and time is used as a constraint when planning the order release onto a buy shipment on the primary leg. This constraint only applies when the primary leg contains a voyage. This date is applied against the departure time from the source port of the voyage.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Late Sail Date</span>: The late sailing date and time is used as a constraint when planning the order release onto a buy shipment on the primary leg. This constraint only applies when the primary leg contains a voyage. This date is applied against the departure time from the source port of the voyage.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: These dates do not override order release time window. Â The order release pickup and delivery time windows together with the parameter <a href="../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm#ORDER_WINDOW_TIME_SPAN">Order Window Time Span</a> must be compatible with the early and late sail dates for the shipment to be scheduled successfully. Â </p>
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If early or late sail dates or voyage ID is defined on order; when this order is on a consol shipment with the voyage ID, the consol shipment must leave between the sail dates i.e., first stop departure must be between early or late sail date. Â Voyage ID on the consol shipment must be same as the voyage ID on order. Â If the order is planned on a consol shipment without voyage ID, the system will ignore the sail dates and voyage ID on order.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The <a href="../../schedule_manager/create_voyage.htm">Voyage ID</a> is used as a constraint when planning the order release onto a buy shipment on the primary leg. This constraint only applies when the primary leg contains a voyage.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">External Voyage Code</span>Â indicates the voyage number.</li>
      </ol>
