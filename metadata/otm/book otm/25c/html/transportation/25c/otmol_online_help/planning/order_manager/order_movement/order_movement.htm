    <div role="main">
      <p>This page is reached via <span class="Bold">Order Management &gt; Order Movement &gt; Order Movement</span>.</p>
      <p>An order movement allows you to plan portions of an order release based on routing. For example, you may want:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One transport planner to manage exporting an order from source to port.</li>
        <li>A second transport planner to manage ocean transports from port to port.</li>
        <li>A third transport planner to manage importing the order from port to destination.</li>
        <li>A stand-alone order movement.</li>
        <li>The ability to create and employ an order movement template.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To accommodate this, you would generate one order movement for each itinerary leg: export, ocean, and import. Each transport planner can then manage and build shipments for each order movement.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: You can also use the <a href="../order_rel_actions/manually_create_order_movements.htm">Manually Create Order Movements</a> action on the Order Release Manager to build an order movement.</p>
      <h2>Create Order Movements</h2>
      <p>There are several ways to create an order movement:</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Order movements are automatically created when planning an order release.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Starting in 6.0, just plan the order release in to shipments.Â Order movements are created automatically now for every new shipment.</li>
        <li>Split the movement of an order release based on a matching itinerary with legs to create a permanent order movement. The order release is never split in this case.Â Its movement from source to destination is split among one or more shipments.Â It travels on multiple shipments to get from its source to destination. To do this, you perform the following steps to create shipments and order movements from an order release:
          <ul>
            <li>Create a multi-leg itinerary that defines the route. On this itinerary, you need to populate the Expected Transit Time on all itinerary legs, except the primary leg. Oracle Transportation Management uses the Expected Transit Time to calculate pickup and delivery time windows on order movements.</li>
            <li>Create and split the movement of an order release into movements using the following order release actions:
              <ul>
                <li><a href="../order_rel_actions/create_order_movement_show_itineraries.htm">Create Order Movement - Show Itineraries</a></li>
                <li><a href="../order_rel_actions/create_order_movement_-_best_itinerary.htm">Create Order Movement - With Best Itinerary</a></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Split an existing shipment and create an order movement instead of a new shipment. When splitting an existing shipment you can create an order movement instead of another shipment. You perform the following steps to create shipments and order movements from a shipment:
          <ul>
            <li>Split existing shipment into a permanent order movement using the following shipment actions:
              <ul>
                <li>Split Shipment - Order Release - Split to Direct Shipment: If you leave the shipment unplanned when you use this option to split a shipment, then an order movement will be created.</li>
                <li>Split Shipment - Order Release - Split to Parallel Shipment: If you leave the shipment unplanned when you use this option to split a shipment, then an order movement will be created.</li>
                <li><a href="order_movement_actions/move_to_shipment.htm">Split Shipment - Order Movement</a></li>
                <li><a href="../../shipment_manager/split_shipment_by_ship_unit.htm">Split Shipment - Ship Unit - Split to Direct Shipment</a></li>
                <li><a href="../../shipment_manager/split_shipment_by_ship_unit.htm">Split Shipment - Ship Unit - Split to Parallel Shipment</a></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Use the <a href="../order_rel_actions/build_shipment_on_primary_leg.htm">Build Shipment on Primary Leg</a> action to book an order release on a charter voyage or flight and create order movements for legs prior to and after the primary leg.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Manage Order Movements and Build Shipments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Manage order movements</li>
        <li>Build shipments from order movements using the following order movement actions:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="order_movement_actions/build_shipment_on_a_leg.htm">Build Shipment on Leg</a></li>
            <li><a href="order_movement_actions/build_shipment_with_valid_itineraries.htm">Build Shipment with Valid Itineraries</a></li>
            <li><a href="order_movement_actions/move_to_shipment.htm">Move to Shipment</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Manually Created Order Movements</h3>
      <p>Bulk plan is able to process and plan manually created order movements onto shipments. The logic that checks &quot;Original Leg ID&quot; will use the &quot;Leg ID&quot; if the Original Leg ID is null.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Bulk plan will not consolidate order movements with different Leg IDs. Each manually created order movement will have a unique Leg ID, and thus will not be able to consolidate with other order movements.</p>
      <h2>Order Movement Header</h2>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If you have set the <a href="../../../properties/glog/order_movement.property.htm#glog.order_movement.show_template">glog.order_movement.show_template</a> property to True, you will be asked to enter a template ID when opening the Order Movement Manager.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Order Movement ID</span> is generated by the <a href="../../power_data/business_numbers/business_number_generator.htm">Business Number Generator</a> and cannot be changed after the order movement is created.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Perspective</span> identifies whether this is a buy or sell order movement. The perspective is determined by the perspective of the shipment or itinerary depending on how the order movement was created; for example, from an order release or shipment.</li>
        <li>The planning status of an order movement changes as actions are performed. Click <span class="Bold">Status</span> to display the current <a href="order_movement_status.htm">order movement status</a>.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: The Status button is only displayed when you are viewing/editing an existing order movement.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Creation Process Type</span> identifies whether the order movement was created from an order release (SYSTEM-ITINERARY) or from a shipment (SYSTEM-ACTIONS).</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Order Release ID</span> displays the order release from which this order movement was created.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: The <span class="Bold">Order Release ID</span> and <span class="Bold">Shipment ID</span> fields are read-only fields which appear only on the View and Edit screens.</p>
        </li>
        <li>If there is a shipment associated with this order release, use the <span class="Bold">Shipment ID</span> field to identify it.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Use as a Template</span> option if you intend for this movement to be a template.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: When an order movement is saved as a template, it is not necessary to enter ship units with the order movement.</p>
        </li>
        <li>You cannot change the <span class="Bold">Source Location</span> of an order movement if the order movement Seq No is 1. If you change the source location of an order movement, you should also change the destination location on the previous order movement. If you change the <span class="Bold">Destination Location</span> of an order movement, you should also change the Source Location on the following order movement. Oracle Transportation Management automatically marks the appropriate <span class="Bold">Fixed</span> checkboxes on locations when the order movement is created. When building shipments, the status of both locations must be active or the shipment will not be created.</li>
        <li>You cannot change the <span class="Bold">Early Pickup Date</span> of the first order movement. If this date was blank on the order release, the default is current time - one year.</li>
        <li>You also cannot change <span class="Bold">Late Pickup Date</span> of the first order movement. If this date was blank on the order release, the default is blank.</li>
        <li>You cannot change the <span class="Bold">Early Delivery Date</span> of the last order movement. If this date was blank on the order release, the default is blank.</li>
        <li>You cannot change the <span class="Bold">Late Delivery Date</span> of the last order movement. If this date was blank on the order release, the default is current time + one year or for the last order movement.
          <p><span class="Bold">When &#39;IGNORE ORDER MOVEMENT OPERATIONAL DATES = FALSE&#39;</span></p>
          <p>For &#39;Early Pickup Date&#39; and &#39;Operational Early Pickup Date&#39;, OTM will take the later of these two fields.</p>
          <p>For &#39;Late Delivery Date&#39; and &#39;Operational Late Delivery Date, OTM will take the earlier of these two fields.</p>
          <p><span class="Bold">Early Pickup Date Calculation</span></p>
          <p>When creating order movements from an order release, the Early Pickup Date of the order movement is calculated based on the time window of the order release as well as related information (primary leg or not and estimated transit time) on the itinerary leg.</p>
          <p>The calculation is as follows:</p>
          <p>For the first order movement (order movement created on first leg), the order movement early pickup date = order release early pickup date.</p>
          <p>For order movements corresponding to legs after the main leg (main leg is defined as primary leg or leg without estimated transit time specified), order movement early pickup date = order movement early delivery date - estimated transit time on leg; the first order movement early delivery date is the order release early delivery date</p>
          <p>For other order movements, the order movement early pickup date = previous order movement early pickup date + estimated transit time on leg; the first previous order movement early pickup date is the order release early pickup date.</p>
        </li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Original Leg ID</span> shows the original ID. There are <a href="../../../actions/ignore_constraints.htm">order movement constraints</a> used for planning so you can ignore this constraint if desired. If two order movements are planned together, the alphabetically or numerically first original ID is used.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Original Leg Position</span> is a relative position of the original leg to the primary leg in the itinerary such that a primary leg&#39;s position is 0 and positions for legs to left of the primary legs (pre-transport) are -1, -2, etc. Positions for legs after the primary leg are 1, 2, etc. There are <a href="../../../actions/ignore_constraints.htm">order movement constraints</a> used for planning so you can ignore this constraint if desired.
          <p>Here is an example of how the Original Leg ID and Original Leg Position fields get populated: when order movements are created from an itinerary, suppose the itinerary has four legs and leg3 is the primary leg. Then we have the following Order Movements created:</p>

          <p>For bulkplan: OTM consolidates order movements with the same original leg position. However, there is a parameter &quot;ALLOW DIFF ORIG LEG GID OMS CONSOLIDATE&quot; to control whether to consolidate order movements with different leg IDs.</p>
          <p>For multi-stop order movement action: you can use the parameter &quot;ALLOW DIFF ORIG LEG GID OMS CONSOLIDATE&quot; to either allow or not allow order movements with different original leg IDs to be consolidated. Additionally, in the Ignore Criteria page, you can also choose:</p>
          <p>Ignore Same Original Leg ID</p>
          <p>Ignore Same Original Leg Position</p>
          <p>If you choose to Ignore Same Original Leg ID, then OTM will consolidate order movements with different original leg ID regardless of the setting for the parameter &quot;ALLOW DIFF ORIG LEG GID OMS CONSOLIDATE&quot;.</p>
          <p>If you choose to Ignore Same Original Leg, then OTM will consolidate order movements with different original leg positions.</p>
        </li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Parent Source/Destination Location IDs</span> only appear if this order movement was created using the Build Buy Shipment on Primary Leg action. It displays the source and destination locations of the charter voyage when the <a href="../../../schedule_manager/charter_voyage/charter_voyage_stowage_detail.htm">stowage modes</a> for the charter voyage have terminal locations defined.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Total Weight</span>, <span class="Bold">Total Volume</span>, and <span class="Bold">Total Ship Unit Count</span> fields are all calculated from the ship units on the order movement and are read-only.</li>
        <li><a name="priority" id="priority"></a>Enter a <span class="Bold">Priority</span> if you want to differentiate some order movements as a high, medium or low priority for planning purposes. Valid values are 1-999, the higher the number, the higher the priority. You can define it&#39;s use as well as the upper limit of the low priority and medium priority by using <a href="../../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm">parameters</a>. There are additional parameters to determine weighting and use of priority.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a name="route_sequence" id="route_sequence"></a>Pickup Routing Sequence</span> and <span class="Bold">Dropoff Routing Sequence</span> control the <a href="../../power_data/planning/routing_sequence.htm">routing sequence</a>; how Oracle Transportation Management plans the sequence of shipment stops that are built from an order base.</li>
        <li><a name="network_routable" id="network_routable"></a>The <span class="Bold">Network Routable</span> checkbox can only be selected if adding a new order movement.

      </ol>
      <h2>Constraints</h2>
      This section gives you the opportunity to create/view/edit additional information about the order movement, including equipment group information, service provider information, rating, and transit time. If the property <a href="../../../properties/glog/business.property.htm#order.ignoreOrderMovementConstraints">glog.business.order.ignoreOrderMovementConstraints</a> is true, order movement constraints, such as service provider, transport mode etc will be ignored for shipment actions. The constraints from order release, if any, will still be used. The default is false.
      <ol>
        <li><span class="Bold">Ship with Group</span> functionality acts as an order planning constraint to prevent orders in a given bulk plan with non-identical Ship with Group ID&#39;s from bundling into shipments. A value of &#39;null&#39; (default value) will bundle with all other orders with a value of &#39;null&#39; but will not be considered a bundling candidate for an order with the Ship with Group field populated with any value. Similarly, multiple orders, in the same bulk plan with identical Ship with Group ID&#39;s will be considered candidates for consolidation, while other orders in that same bulk plan with dissimilar Ship with Group ID&#39;s will not.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Leg Classification ID</span> this is used for order movement group building. See parameter <a href="../../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm#bplegclassification">BULK PLAN ORDER MOVEMENTS BY LEG CLASSIFICATION</a>. If using this logic, the logic will handle only order movements with a leg classification, and will not plan those without a leg classification.</li>
        <li>Planning populates the <a href="../../power_data/25_general/leg_consolidation_group.htm">Leg Consolidation Group</a> based on the following rules:
          <ol>
            <li>If the order movement is being created for a leg with a leg classification, and the order release has an Order Release Leg Constraint entry for that leg classification, then the order movement will get the leg consolidation group from that order release leg constraint entry (unless it is null).</li>
            <li>If there is no order release leg constraint entry for the leg&#39;s leg classification, and if the order movement is being created for a primary leg, then the order movement will get the Leg Consolidation Group from the order release (unless it is null).</li>
            <li>If after a and b, OTM has not found a non-null value for Leg Consolidation Group, and if the order movement is being created for a leg with a leg consolidation group, then the order movement will get this value from the leg, even if it is null.
              <p>You can also edit an order movement&#39;s Leg Consolidation Group.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Routing Constraint ID</span> shows the Routing Constraints that apply to this Order Movement. The field only displays when the &quot;Network Routable&quot; checkbox is selected.</li>
