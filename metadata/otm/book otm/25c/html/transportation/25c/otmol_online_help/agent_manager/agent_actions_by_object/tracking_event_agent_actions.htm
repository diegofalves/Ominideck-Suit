    <p>This page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Business Process Automation &gt; Agents and Milestones &gt; Automation Agent</span>.</p>
    <p>If you select TRACKING EVENT in the <span class="Bold">Agent Type</span> field and do not select anything in the Data Type Association field, the agent actions listed here are available.</p>
    <p>To use agent actions from other agent types (business objects), select the appropriate data type association. By selecting a data type association, an automation agent of one agent type (business object) can run related agent actions of a different agent type (business object). For example, an automation agent with a shipment agent type can run agent actions available for the order release agent type. To do this, select a data type association of SHIPMENT TO ORDER RELEASE. See the <a href="../actions.htm#add_actions">actions</a> topic for more details.</p>
    <h2><a name="time_zone_detail" id="time_zone_detail"></a>Time Zone Detail for Matching Actions</h2>
    <p>For the match actions MATCH SHIPMENT and LEGACY SHIPMENT MATCHING, the time zone of the event is derived for stop information based on the following hierarchy:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Time zone explicitly specified with the event date time</li>
      <li>The stop&#39;s time zone information is provided with the event</li>
      <li>Derived time zone from the location of the event</li>
      <li>Derived time zone from the stop location of the event</li>
      <li>Server time zone</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The rest of the match actions (listed below) use this hierarchy:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Time zone explicitly specified with the event date time</li>
      <li>Server time zone
        <ul>
          <li>Match Demurrage Transaction</li>

          </td>
          <td>
            <p>Use this agent action to estimate distance:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>From shipment source location to the event location, result is assigned to an agent variable &#39;EVENT_DIST_FROM_SHIP_SOURCE&#39;.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>From event location to shipment destination location, result is added to an agent variable &#39;EVENT_DIST_FROM_SHIP_DEST&#39;. Â </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For distance estimation, the tracking event should be matched to shipment either by providing the shipment ID or by using the Match Shipment agent action. Latitude/longitude must be present for both source and destination location and the tracking event should have the latitude and longitude of location where the event has occurred. The distance returned will be miles.</p>
            <p>Instead of the PL/SQL function call, you can now get the estimated distance from one of the above variables.</p>
            <p>So if you use the below query to know if the location of event is close to the source or destination of the shipment or out of certain range, you will have to change this to use the agent variables saved query. That is, select nvl((select 1 from dual where glogowner.gpoint.estimate_distance($src_lat, $src_long, $ies_lat, $ies_long) &lt;= 1.5),2) from dual;</p>
            <p>needs to be changed to</p>
            <p>select nvl((select 1 from dual where to_number($EVENT_DIST_FROM_SHIP_SOURCE) &lt;= 1.5),2) from dual;</p>
            <p>So assigning variables to get the latitude/longitude of source and destination stops of the shipments is not required. Also, you don&#39;t need to call the PL/SQL function to get the estimated distance.</p>

            <p>Creates or updates <a href="../../planning/shipment_manager/demurrage_transaction.htm">demurrage transactions</a> by copying relevant information from the tracking event to the demurrage transaction. For each equipment on the tracking event, a unique demurrage transaction is created/updated by this action. If there is an existing demurrage transaction, it will be updated. If there is not an existing transaction, a new one will be created.</p>
            <p><span class="Bold">Parameters:</span></p>
            <p>1 - Use Event Status Code as: Options are:Start Event Status Code, End Event Status Code.</p>
            <p>Typically, Constructive Placement or Actual Placement would start the event status code; a release would end it.</p>
            <p>2 - Use Event Location as Constructive Placement Location: If selected (true), it updates the tracking event location information as constructive placement location information on demurrage transaction.</p>
            <p>3 - Use Demurrage Location as: Determines which tracking event location details are used to update the demurrage transaction location. Options are Event Car Destination Location, Event Location</p>
            <p>4 - Use Event Matched Shipment ID as:</p>
            <p>a) Inbound â Indicates if the matched shipment ID against this tracking event should be considered as Inbound Shipment for demurrage transaction. Accordingly, the inbound shipment information is updated on the demurrage transaction.</p>
            <p>b) Outbound â Indicates if the matched shipment ID against this tracking event should be considered as Outbound Shipment for demurrage transaction. Accordingly, the outbound shipment information is updated on the demurrage transaction.</p>
            <p>c) Empty â It implies that no shipment information on tracking event is considered for updating the demurrage transaction.</p>
            <p>Inbound or Outbound Shipment ID is determined based on the link between tracking event and shipment. Hence it is suggested that Match Shipment action is used before triggering this agent action.</p>
            <p>5 - Save Event Detail (for Reports) in: Populates denormalized event details in one of the ten pairs (event status code + event date) of event detail fields that is available in the demurrage transaction table. This enables you to add universal fields that are not specifically defined in the user interface and then mapping them to a report. The report can then look at that column and not need a query to get the extra fields.</p>
            <p>This parameter maybe added using any of the pairs of fields to store the current event status code and event date depending on how your report is configured.Â </p>

            <p>With this agent, OTM calculates the estimated departure time based on the actual/estimated arrival time. It then updates the shipment stop estimated departure time and the shipment end time. These times will be used later in the <a href="#re-drive_downstream_shipments">re-drive downstream shipment</a> agent action.</p>
            <p>When one of the two rush hour methods is used, the shipment stop departure time is determined by adding the time found from the rush hour data to the shipment stop arrival time.

Of these, the entry with the largest rush hour delay will be used.Â The rush hour delay will represent the entire time spent at the location.

Car Location Message, a railroad generated message that reports the location of moving rail cars, including flatbeds carrying intermodal units and does not include any of the shipment details. Also, the same algorithm can be used with an EDI message related to an empty asset movement which does not require a shipment. It finds all matching demurrage events filtered by the following criteria</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Match service provider (matching details are configurable with <a href="../../planning/power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm#match_scac">Match Demurrage Transaction SCAC Fields</a>):

            </ul>
            <p>2-Time Window Tolerance - Used to narrow down to a set of demurrage transactions created within this time window. This helps eliminate old demurrage transactions (that may have same equipment, location), that you do not want to consider for the match.</p>
            <p>Match event time falls between at least one of event time information on a demurrage transaction. A margin is allowed on either side on the window. This window is define as input parameter on agent action.</p>
            <p>3-Match Demurrage Transaction Location With -This parameter determines which location details on the Tracking Event the matching is performed with. The tracking event has two types of locations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Event Car Destination Location - this gives the next location for the car</li>
              <li>Event Location - from which the event is raised</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The destination location is necessary for processing the event for constructive placement. During constructive placement, the demurrage location is the actual destination to which the car or equipment is actually going to be placed.</p>
            <p>Once the matched demurrage tracking event is identified, OTM will create the link between tracking event, the particular equipment on the tracking event and the demurrage event.</p>

            <p>This agent action enables you to identify the shipment groups using various parameters.</p>
            <p>When the shipment groups are identified, this agent action raises SHIPMENT GROUP â LINKED TO TRACKING EVENT on the matched shipment groups.</p>
            <p><span class="Bold">Parameters:</span></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Matching Method: Indicates what data on the tracking event to be used to identify the shipment groups. The values of the matching method are:
                <ul>
                  <li>By Shipment Group: considers shipment group information on the tracking event.</li>
                  <li>By Shipment: considers shipment information on the tracking event.</li>
                  <li>By Order Release: considers order release information on the tracking event.</li>
                  <li>By Order Release Line: considers order release line information on the tracking event.</li>
                  <li>By Saved Query: uses the saved query (shipment group) and identifies the corresponding shipment groups.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Shipment Group Type: Matches shipment groups of the shipment group type you selected using the data provided on the tracking event. For example, if you select the HBL shipment group type, this agent action identifies only those shipment groups of type HBL based on the data provided on the tracking event.</li>
              <li>Apply Event to all Related Shipments / Order Release: If you select a value for this field, tracking event will be matched to all the related shipments or order releases in addition to matched shipment groups. For example, if you select Shipments from the drop-down list, this parameter raises SHIPMENT â LINKED TO TRACKING EVENT on buy shipments which are related to matched shipment groups. For sell side shipments, this parameter raises SELL SIDE SHIPMENT â LINKED TO TRACKING EVENT. If you select Order Releases from the drop-down list, this parameter raises ORDER â LINKED TO TRACKING EVENT on the matched shipment groups related order releases. The values of this parameter are Blank, Shipments, and Order Releases.</li>
              <li>Minimum Number of Matches</li>
              <li>Maximum Number of Matches Â </li>
              <li>Time Window Tolerance: Used to narrow down to a set of shipment groups created within this time window tolerance. This helps eliminate old shipment groups that you do not want to consider for the match. Time window tolerance is applied on the start and end time of the shipment group objects. For example, time window tolerance is set as one day and tracking event date is the current date. This agent action identifiess the shipment groups were the current date falls between shipment group start time -0.5 and shipment group end time +0.5.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Based on the matching method you select, the following additional parameters are added to this agent action.</p>

                <p>Shipment Group Flex Attribute Number: If you select the flex attribute type as string, the values are 1 to 20. For the date or number type, the Â values are 1 to 10. For example, if you select shipment group flex attribute type as String, and shipment group flex attribute number as 1 then this agent action matches the shipment groups whose flex field column (ATTRIBUTE1) data matches with the tracking event flex field column (ATTRIBUTE1) data.</p>
                <p><a href="../../general/order_involved_party.htm">Shipment Group Involved Party Qualifier</a>: For example, if you select shipment group involved party qualifier as RESPONSIBLE_PARTY, and the involved parties which has Â RESPONSIBLE_PARTY as involved party qualifier with the object type as SHIPMENT GROUP on the tracking event then this agent action identifies the shipment groups which has Â RESPONSIBLE_PARTY as involved party qualifier.</p>
                <p><a href="../../planning/power_data/qualifier_maintenance/qualifiers.htm">Shipment Group Reference Number Qualifier</a>: For example, if you select shipment group reference number qualifier as BATCH_NUMBER, then this agent action identifies the shipment groups which has Â BATCH_NUMBER as reference number qualifier and its value must be equal to the reference number qualifier on the tracking event.</p>
