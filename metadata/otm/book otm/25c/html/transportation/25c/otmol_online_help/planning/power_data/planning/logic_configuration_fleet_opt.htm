            <p>This allows you to enter the wait time penalty cost per hour to be considered during the driver assignment optimization. The default, &#39;0&#39;, means no penalty cost. The purpose of this penalty is to avoid assigning drivers to shipments with large wait times in between them. This cost will not be part of the actual shipment cost. It is just used in the evaluation process to form tours with minimum wait times between shipments. Real rates can also be setup for the wait times between shipments (for example, you can use the rate basis item &quot;Driver Idle time from Previous Assignment&quot; and setup cost per hour/day of idle time) and this can be used during the driver assignment optimization to form tours with minimum wait times. In order for the real cost to be properly considered, select &#39;Cost Based Savings&#39; for the parameter <a href="#fleet_savings_calc_type">Fleet Savings Calculation Type</a>. For distance based savings, only this parameter can be used during evaluation to charge a penalty for driver wait times between shipments. For cost based savings, either this parameter or real cost can be used.<br>

            <p>If you have two separate shipments, merging them will cost more since more miles will be covered but it may still make sense to merge them even if you have to incur empty miles. A higher percentage for this parameter will encourage combining shipments with empty miles in between. You can apply a discount to make this look and be more attractive.</p>
            <p>For example, you have two shipments each 100 miles. You can combine them but then you&#39;ll have 20 miles in between with an empty shipment. Is that worth it?</p>
            <p>This allows you to enter the discount percentage to be considered for distance based savings.

            <p>This allows you to enter the fixed cost per resource to be considered in the merge algorithm during the driver assignment optimization. This cost is just used in the evaluation process and is not part of the actual shipment cost. If you set a higher value for this parameter, OTM will encourage adding more shipments to the string even if there is no cost benefit.<br>
              The default is &#39;0&#39;.</p>
            <p>For example, you have 2 shipments and 2 drivers available to be assigned to those shipments. If the shipments are not being strung, driver 1 will drive shipment 1 and driver 2 will drive shipment 2 (assumption).</p>
            <p>There are 2 driver resources used here. So the total cost UNCOMBINED = cost of shipment 1+ cost of shipment 2 + 2 * FLEET FIXED COST PER RESOURCE.</p>
            <p>If you string the shipments together and assign to one driver: Combined Total cost = cost of shipment 1+ cost of shipment 2 + cost of empty distance between shipment 1 and shipment 2 + 1* Fleet FIXED COST PER RESOURCE.</p>
            <p>If COMBINED Total cost is less than the total cost UNCOMBINED, then OTM will string the shipments together.</p>
            <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: This parameter is used only during the evaluation process. It will not be part of the actual shipment cost.</p>
            <p>You may not need to set values for this parameter for most cases. If your objective is to string as many shipments as possible and assign drivers to those shipments, then set a value for this. If you want a minimum cost solution, just use the default value for this parameter.</p>

            <p>If set to &quot;Based on Driver Shift&quot;, the &quot;Stop_Not_Removable&quot; special service is set on the home stop, but the permanent flag is not set on the stop. The state of the special service and permanent flag is used as an indicator for the logic to decide whether to remove the home stop based on the driver shifts or not during the next assignment. If the next assignment for the driver falls on the same shift as the current assignment, then the home stop will be removed. For the next assignment, the driver will start from the last freight stop of the current assignment. Â But, if the next assignment for the driver falls on the next shift or outside the current shift, then the home stop is not removed from the current assignment. The driver will go home after the current assignment and start from the home location for the next assignment.</p>
