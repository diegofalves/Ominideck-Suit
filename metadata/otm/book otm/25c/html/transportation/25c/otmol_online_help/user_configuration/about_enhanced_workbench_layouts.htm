  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">About Enhanced Workbench Layouts</span></h1>
  <div role="main">
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold"><a id="guide_About_Enhanced_Workbench_Layouts"></a>Note</span>: All workbenches available from the PUBLIC menus will automatically open as enhanced workbenches.</p>
    <p>A workbench layout is a multi-pane layout that can contain one or more of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>tables</li>
      <li>maps</li>
      <li>a Gantt chart</li>
      <li>manager layouts</li>
      <li>3D load configuration viewers</li>
      <li>analytics projects and reports</li>
      <li>shipment timelines</li>
      <li>diagrams (for routing networks only)</li>
      <li>diagnostics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each layout can have multiple regions, with each region containing panes that display different, but related, information. For example, you might have a workbench containing a layout that has three panes: a list of buy shipments, a map, and a driver or work assignment Gantt chart. The map would display the routes of the buy shipments, order movements, order releases, and drivers or work assignments, while the Gantt chart would show the buy shipments and drivers or work assignments.</p>
    <p>The workbench designer allows you to create and edit workbench layouts. See <a href="enhanced_workbench_designer.htm">Enhanced Workbench</a>Â for more information.</p>
    <p>You can open both legacy Workbench or Enhanced Workbench layouts. However, the legacy Workbenches are read-only. To convert a legacy Workbench layout to an Enhanced Workbench layout, use the <a href="workbench_managerr.htm">Workbench Manager</a>.</p>
    <p>You can setÂ <a href="../user_preferences/setting_user_preferences.htm">User Preferences</a>, calledÂ <span class="Bold">Home Workbench Layout ID</span>, to use a certain enhanced workbench layout as your landing page when you sign in.</p>
    <p>OTM and GTM include a variety of PUBLIC layouts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>OTM mapping actions which use workbench layouts</li>
      <li>Sample workbench layouts which are examples of how you can use workbench layouts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a id="add_mapping_workbenches"></a>OTM Mapping Action Layouts</h2>
    <p>The following OTM actions use an enhanced workbench layout to display OTM objects on a map and a table.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../bulk_plan_manager/map_bulk_plan_results.htm">Map Bulk Plan Results</a> action uses the BULK PLAN VIEW WORKBENCH enhanced workbench</li>
      <li><a href="../asset_mgt/map_bulk_plan_results.htm">Map Fleet Bulk Plan Results</a> action uses the FLEET BULK PLAN RESULTS enhanced workbench</li>
      <li><a href="../planning/location_manager/map_location.htm">Map Inbound Shipments</a> action uses the VIEW SHIPMENTS enhanced workbench</li>
      <li><a href="../planning/order_manager/order_rel_actions/map_order_releases.htm">Map Order Releases</a> action uses the VIEW ORDER RELEASES enhanced workbench</li>
      <li><a href="../planning/location_manager/map_location.htm">Map Outbound Shipments</a> actionÂ action uses the VIEW SHIPMENTS enhanced workbench</li>
