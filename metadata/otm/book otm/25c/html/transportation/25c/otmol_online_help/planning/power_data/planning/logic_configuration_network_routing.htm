            <p>If set to true, service provider assignment logic is used to allocate shipments for each order movement group, after shipments have been built for that group (and thus before shipments are built for subsequent order movements groups). Order movement groups are typically based on the <a href="../25_general/leg_consolidation_group.htm">Leg Consolidation Groups</a> defined on the legs (itinerary or network legs).</p>
            <p>The default is false so service provider assignment is not called until after all shipments have been built.</p>
            <p>This logic is useful when commitment allocations, commitment counts, or capacity limits are set up specifically for legs or groups of legs that belong to the same leg consolidation group.</p>
            <p>It is not as useful if commitment allocations, commitment counts, or capacity limits are set up on a more global level, where legs that belong to different leg consolidation groups will contribute towards the same commitment allocations, commitment counts, or capacity limits.</p>
            <p>If the service provider assignment logic is to be used, the existing <a href="list_of_planning_parameters.htm#commitment">PLAN SHIPMENTS WITH CARRIER COMMITMENT</a> parameter still needs to be turned on (true).</p>

            <p>When either or both of these parameters are set to TRUE, the dynamic clustering algorithm will be performed at the beginning of route selection for the orders. Multistop logic will be used for each set of orders starting (or ending) in the same region, in order to determine good multistop shipment opportunities for pickups (or deliveries) within those regions. The dynamic clustering algorithm simulates single stop and multi-stop consolidations on all applicable first legs (if PERFORM DYNAMIC CLUSTER LOGIC FOR SOURCE REGIONS is TRUE) and last legs (if PERFORM DYNAMIC CLUSTER LOGIC FOR DEST REGIONS is TRUE) of the orders to determine the realistic costs and transit times at the source and destination locations of the orders. This results in a more accurate estimate of the true cost and travel times for the orders from order&#39;s source location to first leg&#39;s destination and last leg&#39;s source location to order&#39;s destination location - which translates to better routing decisions. Since consolidations are done at the source and destination legs, the overall run time is expected to be higher.</p>
            <p>If these parameters are FALSE, OTM still looks at the order&#39;s transit time from the order&#39;s source location to the first leg&#39;s destination location and the order&#39;s transit time from the order last leg&#39;s source location to order&#39;s destination location. However, unlike in the case when the parameters are TRUE, estimated transit time and costs based on single and multi-stop dynamic clustering logic is not performed.<br>
              These default to FALSE.</p>
            <p>Network Routing logic makes some assumptions in order to simplify the order routing problem. These include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the use of abstracted costs to model in simplified way the actual rated costs on legs,</li>
              <li>the use of regions at routing network source and destinations to represent consolidation opportunities in a simplified way.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These assumptions may be justified in many business scenarios.</p>
            <p>Use of dynamic clustering is recommended when:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The correct routing decisions depend in part on determining the correct multistop shipments on the pickup or delivery legs, because:
                <ul>
                  <li>multistop consolidation opportunities cannot be known without considering the actual multistop shipment costs, and/or</li>
                  <li>time-feasible transit through the network cannot be known without considering the actual multistop shipment transit times.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Higher bulk plan run-time is acceptable.(when additional run-time is not a problem, dynamic clustering can be used in order to better represent multistop consolidation opportunities and costs. Dynamic clustering uses the OTM multistop logic in order to analyze multistop consolidation opportunities within the routing network source and destination regions. This analysis includes a consideration of true transit times during multiple pickups or deliveries, as well as true rated cost of multistop shipments).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Consider the following cases, in which orders are picked up at different sources and sent into a throughpoint hub to be routed through the network to their destinations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If each source location is assigned to one specific hub, then dynamic clustering is not needed, because there is only one pickup leg. No decision is needed about which pickup leg to use.</li>
              <li>If, for a source location, there is a choice of hubs to which to send the orders, then dynamic clustering will be useful, because the pickup shipments will have different timing or cost characteristics depending upon which hub they go to.</li>

            <p>In <a href="../../itinerary_manager/network_routing.htm">Network Routing</a>, OTM computes transit times for the leg options only once and uses those times throughout the route-finding logic, assuming that they remain the same regardless of different start times on the leg. This can cause incorrect results in case of transport modes (e.g. PARCEL) where transit times can change significantly based on the start time. For example, a ground parcel shipment starting on Monday usually spends 4 days in transit and gets delivered on Friday, whereas the same parcel shipment will take more time (up to 6 days) if started on a Thursday, due to the weekend.</p>
            <p>Network routing can consider time-dependent transit time if using TIMEDEFINITESERVICE or DAYDURATION <a href="../../rate_manager/rate_service_attributes.htm">rate service</a> types. To do so, this parameter must be set to true.</p>
            <p>Additionally, since it is not practical for OTM to call the external rating engine (for TIMEDEFINITESERVICE) to get the transit time for every start time and every order, OTM will compute these times by taking into account the calendar that mainly influences time-dependent nature. For this rate service type, this calendar is usually set up with the external rating engine. You will need to specify the same calendar on the rate service.</p>
