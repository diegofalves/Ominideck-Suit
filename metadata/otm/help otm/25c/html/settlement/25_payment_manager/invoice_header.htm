    <div role="main">
      <p><span class="glossterm">T</span>his page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Financials &gt; Payment Invoice Management &gt; Payment Invoice.</span></p>
      <p><span class="glossterm">Payment</span> invoices are business objects that document payments owed to service providers, carriers, and other parties. Bills are business objects that document payments due from shippers and other customers. Invoices are buy-side records, and <a href="../billing_manager/create_bill1.htm">bills</a> are sell-side records.</p>
      <p>The invoice manager enables you to manage the <a href="buy_side_financials_flow.htm">buy-side financials process</a>, from entering and editing payment invoices to matching invoices to buy shipments, approving invoices for payment, and allocating and issuing vouchers.</p>
      <p>The invoice manager includes the following sets of rules and rule profiles that help you automate the buy-side financials process. Rules are parameters for performing an action. Rule profiles are ordered sets of rules.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="../match_rule_manager/match_rule.htm">Match Rules</a> and <a href="../match_profile_mgr/match_rule_profile.htm">Match Rule Profiles</a></span> specify the service provider and reference number qualifiers to be used when automatically matching invoices to shipments.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="../auto_approve_rule_mgr/new_auto_approve_rule.htm">Auto Approve Rules</a> and <a href="../auto_approve_rule_mgr/new_autoapprove_profile.htm">Auto Approve Rule Profiles</a></span> specify the allowable ranges (of amounts due and weights) between invoices and their matched shipments when automatically approving invoices for payment.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="../allocation_rule_manager/alloc_rule_mgr_overview.htm">Allocation Rules</a> and <a href="../allocation_rule_manager/new_allocation_profile.htm">Allocation Rule Profiles</a></span> specify the metrics (for example, weight, volume, piece count, etc.) used to allocate both the planned and vouchered transportation costs of invoices and bills.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="../match_validation/match_validation_rule.htm">Match Validation Rules</a></span> and <a href="../match_validation/match_valid_rule_profile.htm">Match Validation Rule Profiles</a> are used after a shipment is matched to an invoice. The match is then validated by comparing reference numbers on the orders and shipments to reference numbers on the invoice.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="../line_approval/line_approval_tolerance_rule.htm">Line Approval Tolerance Rules</a></span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="../line_approval/line_approval_tolerance_rule_profile.htm">Line Approval Tolerance Rule Profiles</a></span> establishes tolerance thresholds for individual shipment cost/invoice lines.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Use the invoice manager to enter new payment invoices or edit saved ones. Invoices can be created by manual entry, by a system process, or via integration from another system.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Invoices created via integration cannot be deleted if the invoice&#39;s voucher has already been issued.</p>
      <p>Manually entering or editing an invoice involves selecting and changing data in fields in these tabs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="invoice_header.htm#Invoice Header">Header</a></span>: for required and basic data such as the invoice number.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="involved_parties_for_invoices_and_bol_backs.htm">Involved Parties</a></span>: for listing contact and location information.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="../billing_manager/lineitem_summary_bm.htm">Line Item</a></span>: for line item data, such freight charges, accessorials, and <a href="../../field_definitions/declared_value.htm">declared values</a>.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="../billing_manager/create_bill2.htm">Routes/Ports</a></span>: for route, vessel, and status data.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="../billing_manager/equipment_summary_bm.htm">Equipment</a></span>: for the equipment data.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="../billing_manager/stop_summary_bm.htm">Stop</a></span>: for stop data and reference numbers.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="../billing_manager/create_bill6.htm">Summary</a></span>: for the required freight charges and related data.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a href="../billing_manager/summary_detail_bm.htm">Summary Detail</a></span>: for freight charges, accessorials, and other data related to steamship shipments only.</li>
        <li><a href="text_templates.htm"><span class="Bold">Remarks</span></a>:for comments and text templates associated with the bill.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a id="Invoice Header"></a>Header</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Invoice ID</span> is entered automatically. It is an unique identifier for the invoice generated by the <a href="../../planning/power_data/business_numbers/business_number_generator.htm">Business Number Generator</a> (BNG) when you save the invoice.</li>
        <li>Enter an <span class="Bold">Invoice Number</span> that matches the number on the invoice supplied by the service provider.</li>
        <li>Select an appropriate <span class="Bold">Financial Consolidation Type</span>. Choose STANDARD for a stand-alone invoice, PARENT for a parent invoice (for example, a consolidation invoice), or CHILD for a child invoice.</li>
        <li>If this invoice is a child invoice, the <span class="Bold">Parent Invoice ID</span> field automatically populates.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: A consolidated invoice is a parent invoice that combines a group of shipments that have the same service provider. Each shipment related to the parent invoice has its own child invoice, which is used for invoice-to-shipment matching.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Original Invoice ID</span> field populates with the invoice ID of the original invoice if there is an adjustment that creates a new invoice or a credit note.</li>
        <li>Enter <span class="Bold">Service Provider Alias Qualifier</span> to define the type of service provider.</li>
        <li>Enter a <span class="Bold">Service Provider Alias</span> to uniquely identify the service provider.</li>
        <li>Enter a <span class="Bold"><a href="../../planning/location_manager/create_sp.htm">Service Provider</a> ID</span>.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: The public data Service Provider Alias Qualifiers include GLOG, SC (for SCAC), and XX (for qualifiers mutually defined by service providers and logistics companies). If the Service Provider Alias Qualifier is GLOG, then the Service Provider Alias should include a domain name, followed by a period, followed by the alias value (for example, SHIPPING.XYZCO, for the SHIPPING domain and the XYZCO alias). Invoices that have GLOG Service Provider Aliases without domain name prefixes cannot be automatically matched to buy shipments.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Select the <a href="../../planning/power_data/25_payment/pay_method_codes.htm">Payment Method</a> from the drop-down list.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Amount Due</span> is the sum of the base and other charges (see Charges and Discounts) for the invoice, less any applicable VAT taxes. When an invoice is added through integration the amount due is automatically calculated. When an invoice is manually entered, the amount due is calculated when the invoice is saved.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: The value displayed in this field is tied to the currency displayed beside it. To determine if that currency is the functional currency or not, click View (<img alt="view" src="../../assets/images/func_glasses_16_ena.png">) to see a pop-up window containing the data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>To override the amount due calculation, select the <span class="Bold">Fixed Cost</span> checkbox; then the amount due that you enter will be used regardless of the base and other charges.</li>
        <li>Use the <span class="Bold">Credit Note</span> field to indicate that this is a credit note. Credit Notes are used for auditing to effectively &quot;cancel out&quot; a rejected invoice. Credit Notes are represented as invoices, but are not actually processed. In other words, they are not approved, vouchered, etc.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Invoice Source</span> indicates how the invoice was created: <span class="Bold">Manual</span> for manually entered invoices, <span class="Bold">GLOG</span> for invoices generated by system processes such as the buy shipment Create Invoice action or automation agents, and <span class="Bold">Integration</span> for invoices imported from other systems.</li>
        <li>To enable this invoice to be approved for payment without being matched to a shipment, select the <span class="Bold">Pass Through</span> checkbox.</li>
        <li>If travelling by vessel, enter a <span class="Bold">Vessel ID.</span></li>
        <li>The GL Date field (read-only) lists the GL date associated with the invoice.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Amount Due with VAT</span> is the total amount due plus any applicable value added taxes (VAT). The applicable VAT data appears at the bottom of the Header tab.</li>
        <li><a name="invoice_date" id="invoice_date"></a>The Due Date specifies when payment is due, and the Start Date and End Date indicate when the invoiced service was provided. The Date Received is the date on which the invoice was received by your organization.</li>
        <li>Select the currency for the invoice from the <span class="Bold">Currency</span> drop-down list.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Exchange Rate Date</span> and <span class="Bold">Exchange Rate ID</span> fields will be populated if an exchange rate date is set on an object.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Consolidation Constraint Set</span> field specifies the consolidation criteria used to generate the parent invoice. When you execute the agent action <a href="../../agent_manager/agent_actions_by_object/invoice_agent_actions.htm#Add_to_Consolidated_Invoice">Add To Consolidation Invoice</a>, the <span class="Bold">Consolidation Constraint Set</span> field is populated on theÂ generated parent invoice based on the constraint set defined in the agent action.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="Charges" id="Charges"></a>Charges and Discounts</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Base Charge</span> is the sum of the shipping charges for the invoice. For consolidated (parent) invoices, the other and base charges are the sum of those charges for all their child invoices.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Other Charge</span> is the sum of the accessorial and other non-shipping charges for the invoice.</li>
        <li>A <span class="Bold">Discount Amount</span> or a <span class="Bold">Discount Percentage</span> can be entered, but not both. In either case, the value entered expresses the discount per se, not the total remaining after the discount.</li>
        <li>A <span class="Bold">Discount Days Due</span> or a <span class="Bold">Discount Due Date</span> can be entered to specify the last day on which the discount applies.</li>
        <li>To specify the type of pickup or delivery service provided by rail or ocean-going shipments, enter a <span class="Bold"><a href="../../planning/power_data/25_payment/service_codes.htm">Service Code</a></span>.</li>
        <li>To specify the responsibilities of buyers and sellers for delivery under a sales contract, enter an <span class="Bold"><a href="../../planning/power_data/order_management/inco_terms.htm">Incoterm</a></span>.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Correction Code</span> is a two-character alphanumeric code that specifies whether this is an original or a corrected invoice (for example, 00 may be used to designate an original).</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a id="Protective Services"></a>Protective Services</h2>
      <p>Protective services instructions are used primarily for rail shipments.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter a <span class="Bold">Sequence Number</span> for the instruction (for example, 1 for the first).</li>
        <li>For the <span class="Bold">Service Code</span>, enter the type of perishable protective service (for example, HDN for Do Not Heat).</li>
        <li>For the <span class="Bold">Service Rule Code</span>, enter the Association of American Railroads (AAR) protective service that applies.</li>
        <li>Enter the optimal <span class="Bold">Temperature</span> for the shipment, in the selected measure.</li>
        <li><span class="Emphasize">After entering a protective service instruction, click</span> <span class="Bold">Save</span><span class="Emphasize">.</span> <span class="Emphasize">Enter</span> <span class="Emphasize">and save other sequenced instructions if needed</span>.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a id="Letter of Credit"></a>Letter of Credit</h2>
      <p>You can identify a letter of credit from a bank or lending institution that authorizes withdrawals within set limits for use in paying this invoice.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter the <span class="Bold">Letter of Credit Issue Date</span>.</li>
        <li>Enter the <span class="Bold">Letter of Credit Expiration Date.</span></li>
        <li>Enter the <span class="Bold">Letter of Credit Number</span>.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="VAT" id="VAT"></a>VAT</h2>
      <p>The fields in the VAT section are applicable to invoices that have a VAT (value added tax) added to them. This is most common in Europe. These fields are automatically populated when the <a href="26_payment_actions/calculate_vat.htm">Calculate VAT</a> action is run against an invoice. You can alternatively enter the appropriate information in these fields manually. This allows you to calculate tax for manually entered invoices. This is based on the information you input manually instead of running VAT calculation.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Supply Country Code ID</span> represents the country that the goods are coming from.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Servprov VAT Registration ID</span> is the VAT tax ID for the service provider.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Customer VAT Registration ID</span> is the VAT tax ID for the customer. Both the Servprov and Customer VAT Registration ID&#39;s are pulled from the <a href="../../planning/power_data/corporations/corporations.htm">Corporation</a> section in Power Data.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">VAT Exempt</span> checkbox if the invoice is exempt from the tax.</li>
        <li>If VAT Exempt is selected, you need to specify whether the invoice is <span class="Bold">Exempt with Credit</span> or <span class="Bold">Exempt without Credit</span>.</li>
        <li>If you select the VAT Analysis Fixed checkbox, you can manually edit the following.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">VAT Code ID</span> is the tax that is being applied to the invoice.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">VAT Basis Amount</span> is the amount that is taxed at the given VAT Code&#39;s rate.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">VAT Rate</span> is the percentage of tax that is being applied to the invoice.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">VAT Amount</span> field is a dollar amount to be added to the invoice.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The <a href="../../planning/power_data/rates_and_codes/vat_codes.htm">VAT Code</a> and VAT Rate are maintained in Power Data. The VAT Amount field is used when you are entering data in these fields to be used later by an external system.</p>
      <p>VAT Analysis shows the <span class="Bold">VAT Code</span> and the <span class="Bold">Amount</span> charged for the VAT for each line item on the invoice.</p>
      <h2><a name="supply_province_registration" id="supply_province_registration"></a>Supply Province Registrations</h2>
      <p>The fields in this section are applicable to invoices that have a Provincial VAT (value added tax) added to them. This is most common in Canada and Australia. These fields are automatically populated when the <a href="../billing_manager/billing_actions/calculate_provincial_tax.htm">Calculate Provincial Tax</a> action is run against an invoice. Alternatively, you can enter the appropriate information in these fields. The data you manually enter will be saved in their respective fields in the database and can be sent to an external system via integration if desired. If the Calculate Provincial Tax action is run after you manually enter data, however, the data you entered will be overwritten by the results of the action.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Country Code ID</span> is the country in which the provincial tax is being applied.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Province Code</span> identifies the actual province to which the VAT applies.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">VAT Provincial Registration ID</span> is the VAT tax ID of the party charging the tax, and is pulled from the Corporation section in Power Data. Since you can have different VATs in different provinces, you can enter as many country and province code combinations as necessary.</li>
      </ol>
