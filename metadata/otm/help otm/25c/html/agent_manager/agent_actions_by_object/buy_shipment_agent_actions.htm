    <p>This page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Business Process Automation &gt; Agents and Milestones &gt; Automation Agent</span>.</p>
    <p>If you select SHIPMENTÂ in the <span class="Bold">Agent Type</span> field and do not select anything in the <span class="Bold">Data Type Association</span> field, the agent actions listed here are available.</p>
    <p>To use agent actions from other agent types (business objects), select the appropriate data type association. By selecting a data type association, an automation agent of one agent type (business object) can run related agent actions of a different agent type (business object). For example, an automation agent with a shipment agent type can run agent actions available for the order release agent type. To do this, select a data type association of SHIPMENT TO ORDER RELEASE. See the <a href="../actions.htm#add_actions">actions</a> topic for more details.</p>
    <p>See <a href="shpt_agent_actions_and_parameters.htm">Shipment Agent Actions that Use Parameter Sets</a> to see which shipment agent actions can take the parameter set as input for overriding the default behavior.</p>

            <p>You can configure the agent action to assign equipment types for different legs. Note that not all legs are applicable to every shipment. It depends on the special services on the shipment. For example, the shipment may have the following legs applicable: drop empty before freight, pick empty before freight, and freight. However, the freight equipment already has the equipment type assigned. If you configure the action to assign the following two legs, drop empty before freight and freight, then this agent action will just assign the equipment type for drop empty before freight. If all specified legs on the agent are already assigned equipment types on a shipment, the agent action will log an exception. All legs on shipments are processed.</p>

This action is available for &quot;Shipment&quot; agent type and returns a failure status so that the agent can be configured to respond to the failures properly.</p>
            <p>The applicable shipment modes for this action are defined by a FLEET EQUIPMENT Logic Config Parameter (ROUNDTRIP NFR STOP TRANSPORT MODE PROFILE). The stop location around which the roundtrip is formed (starts and ends at this location) is determined by a FLEET Equipment Logic Config Parameter (ROUNDTRIP NFR STOP ROLE). The role defined by the parameter must be on one and only one of either the first or last stop on the shipment for proper execution of the action.</p>

This action can help propagate specific reference numbers from one shipment to the next. For example, you may have a multi-modal move such as truck-ocean-truck involving different service providers.

            <p>This agent action is an extension of the <a href="utility_agent_actions.htm#If">IF</a> action. It allows an agent to evaluate the time/distance to a location based on a shipment event. This agent action can only be triggered by a Shipment Status - Received or Shipment Status - Tracking event.</p>
            <p>Based on theÂ location address of the triggering shipment event, the agent action evaluates the drive time to the next stop location as well as the driving distance to the next stop location. If the location specified on the agent action matches the next stop location, the agent action compares the driving distance to the specified distance and the drive time to the specified time.</p>
            <p>If the Distance to Location parameter is specified and the driving distance happens to be less than or equal to the specified value and also if the Time to Location parameter is specified and the drive time happens to be less than or equal to the specified value, the action returns TRUE. That is, any agent actions specified in the IF block are executed.</p>
            <p>If the drive time is more than the specified Time to Location and/or the driving distance is more than the specified Distance to Location then the action returns FALSE. That is, any agent actions specified in the IF block are not executed.</p>
            <p>If both the Time to Location and Distance to Location are not specified and the specified location matches the next stop location, the action returns TRUE.</p>

            <p>This agent action can be used to link a shipment with an order base based on order base ship unit line item reference numbers.</p>
            <p>In general, this agent action would be used in conjunction with shipment and/or order creation/modification events that come into to Oracle Transportation Management via integration.</p>
            <p>This agent action searches for order base ship unit line item reference numbers with a qualifier of CIN (although the qualifier that can be searched is configurable). If Oracle Transportation Management finds a match, it uses that reference number and searches for a valid order base ID with the same value. If a matching order base ID is found, Oracle Transportation Management assigns the order base ID to the ship unit line item and populates the Order Base ID field on the Â <a href="../../planning/shipment_manager/multi_create_shipments/line_item_detail.htm">Shipment Ship Unit Line Item Detail</a> page. Oracle Transportation Management then finds the first order release ID for the order base and populates the Order Release field on the same page thereby connecting the order with the shipment.</p>
            <p><span class="Bold">Parameters</span>:</p>
            <p>Qualifier ID for order base link</p>
            <p>Qualifier ID for order release line link</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You can select one tag # 1 ~ 4 for a linking match.</li>
              <li>If a shipment is to link to two order bases, ob_1 through CIN/TAG1, ob_2 through CIN/TAG2, you should use two link actions in one link agent for each pair of linking parameters.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Copy quantity from order base to ship unit line (updating existing ship unit line):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If this parameter is marked, Oracle Transportation Management copies the Packaged Item ID, Item Packaged Count, Weight (UOM) and Volume (UOM) from the order release line to the shipment ship unit line based on the assumption that the values in order base line have been copied to order release during the releasing process. Order Release Lines are to be added to the corresponding matched shipment additively; i.e., a shipment ship unit line has been matched to an order release ID, then all lines on that order release are to be copied as additional lines to the shipment. This process does not overwrite or change the line that matched to the order base and order release in the first place.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Create Sibling Shipment Unit Lines:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If the linked order release has additional lines that were not on the shipment, you can mark this checkbox to have Oracle Transportation Management copy those lines as new shipment ship unit lines.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Remove Shipment Unit Lines:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If an unlink was performed via the Unlink Order Base to Shipment action, mark this checkbox to remove sibling shipment ship unit lines that may have been added using the parameter mentioned above.</li>

            <p>This agent action is used when a service provider has decided to partially accept a tender by transport handling unit.

Therefore, set up this agent action to trigger when Â the SHIPMENT TENDER - PARTIALLY ACCEPTED lifetime event is raised.</p>

            <ol>
