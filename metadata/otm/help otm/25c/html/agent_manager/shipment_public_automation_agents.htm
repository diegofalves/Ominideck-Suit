  <div role="main">
    <p>Oracle Transportation Management provides sample <a href="new_workflow_agent.htm">automation agents</a> in the PUBLIC domain. It is recommended that all PUBLIC automation agents be deactivated upon installation. You can make copies of these PUBLIC automation agents in non-public domains. In these non-public domains, you can make changes to the sample automation agents so that they fit your business process.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: PUBLIC automation agents should never be deleted.</p>
    <p>The following PUBLIC automation agents are available for the agent type of SHIPMENT.</p>
    <h2><a name="auto_synch_shipment" id="auto_synch_shipment"></a>Auto Sync Shipment to Trade Transaction</h2>

For example, if a delayed event is received for stop 2, then involved parties for stop 2, 3, 4,... Â are notified that their orders have been delayed. It also listens for a number of SHIPMENT STATUS - xxx Oracle Transportation Management events. In a way, it just forwards the event from the shipment side to the order release side.</p>

    <h2><a name="conditional_booking" id="conditional_booking"></a>Shipment Conditional Booking - Rerate and Redrive</h2>
    <p>This agent listens for conditional booking modified events and rerates and/or redrives the shipment and conditionally redrives downstream shipments and upstream shipments depending on location profile and shipment status.Â SHIPMENT - CONDITIONAL BOOKING MODIFIED is a parent event of SHIPMENT - CB VOYAGE MODIFIED and SHIPMENT - CB STOPS MODIFIED. The parent event can be raised separately or along with the child. This only gets triggered when changes are made by the conditional booking, not by shipment edits.</p>
    <p>SHIPMENT - CONDITIONAL BOOKING MODIFIED is raised when any of a variety of fields are modified on Conditional Booking UI including location and date fields.</p>
    <p>This agent action can change the voyage even if the <a href="../planning/shipment_manager/multi_create_shipments/multi_mode.htm#fixed_voyage">Voyage Fixed</a> checkbox on the shipment is selected. To avoid overriding a fixed voyage with an agent, you can add an IF statement: &quot;If fixedVoyageFlagOnShipment is false Assign Voyage&quot;.</p>

    <h2><a name="ship_event_tracker" id="ship_event_tracker"></a>Shipment Event Tracker</h2>
    <p>This automation agent is activated by <a href="../planning/power_data/25_status_messages/event_group.htm">shipment event groups</a> and shipment events with matching <a href="../planning/power_data/25_status_messages/status_codes.htm">shipment status codes</a>. The automation agent only considers attributes in a shipment event group with the attribute IS_TRACKING = Y.</p>
    <p>The automation agent Â is responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Setting appropriate internal statuses for the shipment</li>
      <li>Raising appropriate Shipment Status - Received events. Examples of Shipment Status - Received events are Shipment Status - Completed and Shipment Status - Enroute.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Potential changes to this agent are: defining the shipment as completed when shipments arrive at their last stop instead of when they depart their last stop, set your own custom events and statuses, and trigger separate agents for specific status codes.</p>
    <p>This automation agent is not active by default.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If this agent needs to be triggered when a tracking event is entered, the tracking event agent action &quot;<a href="agent_actions_by_object/tracking_event_agent_actions.htm#leg_ship_match">Legacy Shipment Matching</a>&quot; needs to be used as it will publish the event &quot;SHIPMENT STATUS - TRACKING&quot; when a tracking event is successfully matched to a shipment.</p>

    <h2><a name="update_capac_alloc" id="update_capac_alloc"></a>Update Capacity Allocation</h2>
    <p>The accounting of commitment usage for planned number of shipments will occur when shipment is created, deleted or modified due to the change of service provider and/or shipment start time. When a shipment is created, all contributing commitment usages (planned-num-of-shipment) will be increased; when a shipment is deleted, the existing contributing commitment usage (planned-num-of-shipment) will be decreased; when shipment is assigned to a new service provider, the new commitment usage will be increased, the old existing commitment usage will be decreased, except for one caseTender Decline. Agent action Update Actual Commitment and Allocation is the accounting of the final count for final commitment usages (such as final_num_of_shipment, final_weight, final_volume, final_mileage, etc). These fields are empty during the shipment planning status; When a shipment reaches certain status (configurable by the client) so that modifications to the shipment is not allowed any more, this agent action is triggered and thus the final usages are accounted.</p>
