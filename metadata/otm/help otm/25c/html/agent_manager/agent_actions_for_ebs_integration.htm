    <h2>About EBS Agents</h2>
    <p>Staged Data is delivered to enable the integration flows with EBS. Any flow out of Oracle Transportation Management to EBS requires an automation agent. The following <a href="actions.htm">agents</a> have been added to be used as guidelines for creating your own agent actions for use with integrating with E-Business Suites (EBS). These automation agents (along with other data) have been delivered in the EBS domain and only exist in the EBS <a href="../user_management/add_domain.htm">domain</a>. You can log in as EBS.ADMIN to review the agents. Upon install, the agents are inactive since they are intended to be a baseline for implementations and will most likely need to be adjusted to accommodate your specific needs. It is recommended that you copy an agent action and modify it as necessary.</p>
    <p>Along with the agents, other data has been defined in the EBS domain including external statuses. If a specific domain is created and EBS configuration is required, it is important to allow the new domain to access the EBS data using domain grants.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>This agent reacts when the order release is planned onto a shipment. It marks the status of shipments if they cannot be accepted by EBS:</p>
            <p>EBS cannot accept multiple shipments/trips for a single delivery. Shipments are marked as INVALID FOR EBS if there are multiple first leg shipments (a later agent will exclude these from being sent to EBS).</p>
            <p>Additionally, EBS cannot accept shipments that have multiple equipment so they are marked as INVALID FOR EBS as well.</p>
