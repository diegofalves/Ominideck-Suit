    <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Create Secondary Charge</span></h1>
    <div role="main">
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Manager layout capability is added to this action so that you can customize the input page (i.e. hide some fields, make some fields mandatory, etc.). In the Screen Set Manager, you are provided with the Action options:
        <br>
        <span class="Bold">Create Secondary Charge</span>: Select this option to avail the action as a manager layout. This is available by default on the finder actions.
        <br>
        <span class="Bold">Create Secondary Charge (Deprecated)</span>: Select this option to avail the action as a regular web action page. </p>
      <p>This page is accessed via:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="Bold">Shipment Management &gt; Group Management &gt; Shipment Group &gt; Actions &gt; Shipment Management &gt; Manage Groups and Charges</span></li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Shipment Management &gt; Shipment Management &gt; Buy Shipments or Sell Shipments &gt; Actions &gt; Shipment Management &gt; Manage Groups and Charges</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Secondary charges are non-moving charges that are based on shipments or shipment groups. For example, there may be a secondary charge for fumigating a vessel.</p>
      <p>Secondary charges are used for buy-side activity only to pay service provider invoices. Oracle Transportation Management determines the cost of a specific secondary charge based on the transport mode and rate information entered on the secondary charge.</p>
      <p>Oracle Transportation Management creates secondary charges during shipment planning or you can create them manually. When you create a secondary charge manually, you must associate it with a shipment group or shipment. If the shipment or shipment group with which the secondary charge is associated is deleted, the secondary charge is deleted.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: In order to apply secondary charges for &quot;shipment special service&quot; or &quot;shipment stop special service&quot;, you have to use the <a href="../../planning/shipment_manager/add_third_party_service_provider.htm">Add third party service provider</a> action on the shipment.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: See theÂ <a href="../../properties/glog/shipgroup_properties.htm#glog.shipgroup.createShipmentGroup.useShipmentDomain">glog.shipgroup.createShipmentGroup.useShipmentDomain</a> property to create a secondary charge shipment in the shipment group domain.</p>
      <h2><a name="Create" id="Create"></a>Create Secondary Charge</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>If the checkboxÂ <span class="Bold">Add Multiple Costs</span> is selected, then you can seeÂ a grid consisting of the multiple cost attributes where you can add the multiple costs. At that time the field <span class="Bold">Total Actual Cost</span> is automaticallyÂ hidden. If the checkbox is unchecked then you can only enter a single cost using the field <span class="Bold">Total Actual Cost</span> and the grid Costs is hidden.</li>
        <li>Use the <span class="Bold">Shipment ID</span> to identify the secondary charge. A secondary charge is represented as a shipment in Oracle Transportation Management and acts as the basis for invoice activity.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold"><a href="../../planning/power_data/rates_and_codes/transport_modes.htm">Transport Mode</a></span> that applies for the secondary charge. You can enter a pre-defined transport mode or define a new one that applies specifically to secondary charges. Define transport modes in Power Data (Contract and Rate Management &gt; Rates and Codes).</li>
        <li>Use the <span class="Bold">Service Provider ID</span> field to enter the service provider who receives payment for the secondary charge.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Total Actual Cost</span> field displays the cost determined when the shipment is executed based on the rate offering and record associated with the shipment. Auto Approve Rules in Financials compare the total actual cost with the net amount due on the invoice. You can enter a value in this field manually.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: TheÂ <span class="Bold">Total Actual Cost</span> field only shows when the checkboxÂ <span class="Bold">Add Multiple Costs</span> is unchecked.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Rate Offering</span> that applies for the secondary charge displays. The rate offering defines a general contract with a service provider. It is selected during shipment planning based on the service provider and secondary charges rules. You can enter a rate offering manually by selecting the appropriate offering for the service provider associated with the secondary charge.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Rate Record</span> that applies for the secondary charge displays. The rate record contains the rate cost information that determines the actual cost of the secondary charge. Oracle Transportation Management assigns a rate record during shipment planning based on the service provider and secondary charges rules.</li>
        <li>Enter the required <span class="Bold"><a href="../../planning/power_data/25_general/accessorial_code_profile.htm">Accessorial Code Profile ID</a></span>.</li>
        <li>Enter the required <span class="Bold"><a href="../../planning/rate_manager/special_service_profile.htm">Special Service Profile ID</a></span>.</li>
        <li>Select a <span class="Bold">Location Type</span> <span class="Bold">from the following:</span>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="Bold">Destination</span>: Use the destination of the transportation shipment as the source and destination locations of the secondary charge shipment.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Port of Discharge</span>: Use the port of discharge of the primary leg shipment as the source and destination locations of the secondary charge shipment.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Port of Load</span>: Use the port of load of the primary leg shipment as the source and destination locations of the secondary charge shipment.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Source</span>: Use the source location of the transportation shipment as the source and destination locations of the secondary charge shipment.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Source to Destination</span>: Use the source and destination locations of the transportation shipment as the source and destination locations of the secondary charge shipment.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">All</span>: When selected, all stops of the shipment will be copied to the secondary charge shipment.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Select the appropriate <span class="Bold"><a href="../../planning/power_data/25_payment/pay_method_codes.htm">Payment Method Code ID</a></span>.</li>
        <li>Select a quantity type (Picked Up, Planned, or Received) from the <span class="Bold">Quantity Type</span> drop-down list.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Calculate Ship Unit Duration</span> checkbox to calculate the duration to be considered for this secondary charge.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="Create" id="Create" data-cke-saved-name="Create"></a>Costs</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Select a valid <span class="Bold">Cost Type</span>. The options include Base, Accessorial, Stop-off Charge, Discount, Circuity, Delta, and Other.</li>
        <li>Enter the appropriate <span class="Bold">Shipment Cost</span> and <span class="Bold">Currency</span>.Â </li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Cost Fixed</span> checkbox if you want this cost type to always remain on the shipment regardless of whether the shipment is re-rated. Use this checkbox for manually-applied cost types such as Accessorial or Other. If a shipment is re-rated for any reason, these costs will stay on the shipment as entered. If you mark this checkbox for any other cost types, those cost types and related values will also remain on the shipment; however, new cost types may appear as a result of shipment re-rating which may not make sense. For example, you probably do not want to mark a Base Cost Type as fixed.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Weighted Only</span> checkbox if the displayed cost is a weighted cost. This does not affect the total cost of the shipment.</li>
        <li>In addition to assigning a manual accessorial charge, you can also assign an <span class="Bold"><a href="../../planning/power_data/rates_and_codes/accessorial_codes.htm">Accessorial Code</a></span> and have charges calculated based on the rate that was used for the shipment.</li>
        <li>You can manually assign a <span class="Bold"><a href="../../planning/power_data/25_payment/general_ledger_codes.htm">General Ledger Code</a></span> to the shipment cost, which will be carried through during the allocation process.</li>
        <li>Select a <span class="Bold">Payment Method Code</span>. A Payment Method Codes specifies how the invoice is to be paid. The options available depend on what Payment Methods you have set up in Power Data.</li>
        <li>Assign the cost an <span class="Bold"><a href="../../planning/power_data/25_payment/adjustment_reasons.htm">Adjustment Reason</a></span> to specify why a cost adjustments was made. This will be carried through the financials process and passed along to both the customer bill and the carrier invoice.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: You can add the multiple costs when the checkboxÂ <span class="Bold">Add Multiple Costs</span> is checked.</p>
      <h2><a name="references" id="references"></a>Reference Numbers (to be copied from transport shipment)</h2>
      <p>Use the <span class="Bold"><a href="../../planning/power_data/qualifier_maintenance/qualifiers.htm">Reference Numbers</a></span> section to copy specific transportation shipment reference numbers to the secondary charge shipment to allow invoice matching.</p>
      <h2><a name="involved" id="involved"></a>Involved Parties (to be added to secondary charge shipment)</h2>
      <p>Use the <span class="Bold"><a href="../../general/order_involved_party.htm">Involved Parties</a></span> section to add involved parties to the secondary charge rule to be set on the secondary charge shipment. The <a href="../../user_management/optional_features.htm">optional feature</a>Â &quot;COPY INVOLVED PARTIES FROM SEC CHARGE RULE&quot; is used to control the involved parties when <span>creating the secondary charge shipments</span>. When the optional feature is enabled, the application will exclusively copy the involved parties from the secondary charge rule (i.e, conditions and parties associated with the additional charges, and no involved parties will be copied from the original order) whenÂ <span>secondary charge shipments are created. When the optional feature is disabled, the application will revert to previous behavior where the involved parties will be copied from both the secondary charge rule and the order leading to theÂ incorrect party information being added to the shipment.</span></p>
