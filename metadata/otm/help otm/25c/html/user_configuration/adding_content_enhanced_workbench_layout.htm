  <div role="main">
    <p>This page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Configuration and Administration &gt; User Configuration &gt; Enhanced Workbench </span>.</p>
    <p>To define a new pane, hover over the <img alt="Layout Configuration icon" src="../assets/images/wb_jet_content_editor_icon.png" title="Layout Configuration icon"> <span class="Bold">Layout Configuration</span> icon to see the content editor menu and click <img alt="Add Content icon" src="../assets/images/wb_jet_add_content_icon.png" title="Add Content icon"> <span class="Bold">Add Content</span>. This allows you to add content to a region. If you add content to the same region multiple times, each additional time creates a new component tab within the same region.</p>
    <p>You can add tables, one or more maps, one Driver Gantt chart, one Work Assignment Gantt chart, one or more manager layouts,Â  one or more Load Config components to your layout, etc.</p>
    <h2><a id="Adding_a_Table"></a>Adding a Table</h2>
    <p>You can add a table to a Workbench layout as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select a <span class="Bold">Component Type</span> of Table.</li>
      <li>Select an <span class="Bold">Object Type</span>. Various fields appear only when you have selected a specific object type.</li>
      <li>Enter a <span class="Bold">Tab Name</span>. In the finished workbench, the tab name appears on a tab at the top of the area you are defining. If left blank, the tab name defaults to the object name (for example Buy Shipment).</li>
      <li>Select a <a href="../content_manager/identification.htm"><span class="Bold">Screen Set</span></a>. The screen set defines how the business object is displayed when you click on the ID.</li>
      <li>If you select an object type of Buy Shipment, Driver, Shipment Stop, or Work Assignment, the <span class="Bold">Show Gantt column</span> checkbox appears. Select this checkbox if you want the table to have an In Gantt column in it. The In Gantt column allows you to select items and display them on a pane of the workbench defined to have either a Driver, Work Assignment, or Dock Scheduling Gantt chart.<br>
        <br>
        If you select an object type of Shipment Stop and add as a detail table, the In Gantt column option button appears. The In Gantt column allows you to select an item and display it on a pane of the workbench defined to have a Dock Scheduling Gantt chart.
        <ol>
          <li>For a Driver Gantt chart:
            <ul>
              <li>For a driver, you can select this checkbox to add the driver to the Driver Gantt chart.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>For a Work Assignment Gantt chart:
            <ul>
              <li>For a work assignment, you can select this checkbox to add the work assignment to the Work Assignment Gantt chart.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>For a Dock Scheduling Gantt chart:
            <ul>
              <li>For a shipment stop, you can select this option button to add location resource (dock door) to the Dock Scheduling Gantt chart.</li>
              <li>When you select a shipment stop used with a Dock Scheduling Gantt, the Gantt chart displays existing appointments if any for the selected location.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>When you select an object type of Buy Shipment, Driver, Location, Modeling Scenario, Modeling Shipment, Network, Order Movement, or Order Release, the <span class="Bold">Show map column</span> checkbox appears. Select this checkbox if you want the table to have a Map column in it. The Map column allows you to select items and display them on a pane of the workbench defined to have a map.</li>
      <li>If you want the first row of data in the table to be selected automatically, select the <span class="Bold">Default first row selection </span>checkbox. This option is not selected by default when you add a table.</li>
      <li>If this table is a child table to another table, select the <span class="Bold">Detail Table</span> checkbox. You then see the Combined Detail Type drop-down list and theÂ Associated Tables list.
        <ol>
          <li><a id="grouped_combined_detail"></a>You can select a <span class="Bold">Combined Detail Type</span> to determine how the records in the detail table are displayed. Mass update is supported while inline edit and filters are not supported for a combined detail table. The Combined Detail Types are described below.
            <ul>
              <li><a><span class="Bold">Grouped Combined Table</span></a>Â shows the details of all the parent records selected in the <span class="Bold">Associated Tables</span> saved search as a combined group for easier navigation.<br>
                <br>
                If you select Grouped Combined Table, you see the <span class="Bold">Show Group Combined Collapse</span> checkbox. Select this checkbox to see the results in a grouped format that is collapsed. You can click the <span class="Bold">Expand </span>icon in your workbench results table to see the group expanded.
              </li>
              <li><span class="Bold">Ungrouped Combined Table</span>Â shows the details of all of the parent records selected in the <span class="Bold">Associated Tables</span> saved search as a single list of records.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>In the <span class="Bold">Associated Tables</span> section, you must select at least one associated table saved search. If you select more than one associated table saved search, the detail table is associated with all of those tables. This search establishes the relationship between the parent and detail tables. For example, you can set up a layout with an order release table as the detail table for an accepted shipments parent table and declined shipments main table. It also is a <a href="../agent_manager/saved_query.htm">non-finder-based saved query. </a></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><a id="Group_by"></a>If this is a parent table, you can select <span class="Bold">Grouped Table</span> to determine how the records in the parent table are displayed. When you select the Grouped Table option, you seeÂ <span class="Bold">Saved Groups</span> and <span class="Bold">Group by Columns</span> drop-down lists.
        <ol>
          <li>Click in the <span class="Bold">Group by Columns</span> box to see a list of available columns. Select a column, such as Source Location ID, to group the records in the parent table by that column. You can select more than one column to group by. Mass updated is supported while inline edit and filters are not supported for grouped table.</li>
          <li>Click the <span class="Bold">Save </span>icon to save this group. When you save the group, the newly saved group is moved to the <span class="Bold">Saved Groups</span> drop-down list. The entry selected in the Saved Groups drop-down list is the default selection in the <a href="using_enhanced_workbench_table.htm#saved_group">Saved Groups pop-up</a> on the search results.</li>
          <li>To edit a saved group, click the pencil icon (<span class="Bold">Edit</span>)Â and the group is moved to the <span class="Bold">Group by Column</span> field where you can add or remove columns. When you select Save, the saved group is updated.</li>
          <li>To delete a saved group, select it in the Saved Groups drop-down list and click the <span class="Bold">Clear </span>icon.Â </li>
          <li>To add more saved groups, click the <span class="Bold">New </span>icon to the right of the Group by Columns field. Then, click in the field and select the columns to group by. Click <span class="Bold">Save </span>when the new group is complete.<br>
            <br>
            In the Saved Groups field, multiple Saved Groups can be listed. These can be used when using the workbench table to change how the records on the table are grouped.
          </li>
          <li>If columns containing dates are selected in your Saved Group, you can select the <span class="Bold">Group by Date Option</span> to group the results by one of the following formats:
            <ol>
              <li>Date and Time (default)</li>
              <li>Date</li>
              <li>Month</li>
              <li>Year</li>
              <li>Month and Year</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Once you save the group you can configure the sort order of the grouped columns.
        <ol>
          <li>From the Saved Groups drop-down list, select a <span class="Bold">saved group</span>.</li>
          <li>Select a column from the <span class="Bold">Sort Group by Column</span> drop-down list. This list is populated based on the saved group selected above.</li>
          <li>Click either <span class="Italic">Ascending </span>or <span class="Italic">Descending </span>under<span class="Bold"> Sort Group by Column Order</span>. The default is Ascending.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Select a <span class="Bold">Population Method</span> to determine how a table is populated. The Population Method drop-down list only appears for some objects. The Population Method options are:
        <ul>
          <li>Saved Search allows you to select a <span class="Bold">Default Saved Search</span> so that specific results are populated in the table when you use the layout. Use a default saved search for standard workbench layouts. This appears for objects such as buy shipment, driver, order release, etc.<br>
            <br>
            <span class="Bold">Note</span>: If your layout is set up with a Default Saved Search and if the <a href="../content_manager/general.htm#limit_saved_query">Limit Saved Query</a>Â on the screen set does not include that saved search, then when the workbench layout is opened, the Saved Query values appear but the Saved Search field is blank.
          </li>
          <li>Action allows you to select an <span class="Bold">Action Data Mapping ID</span> so that the table results are populated based on an OTM action. Use this option when a layout is launched from an action where the action knows exactly how to populate the table. Use of this option is only for advanced users, and caution is recommended. This appears for objects such as buy shipment, driver, order release, etc.</li>
          <li>Work Queue allows you to select a <a href="../gtm/powerdata/work_queue.htm"><span class="Bold">GTM Work Queue</span></a> so that the table results are populated based on the GTM work queue. A work queue is a list of tasks that are assigned to a specific user and are used when creating GTM work queue workbench layouts. This appears for the GTM objects contact, party, transaction, transaction line, trade item structure, trade item structure component, declaration, and declaration line.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>In the <span class="Bold">Table Parameters Default</span> section, select the icons that appear in the table toolbar. The icons are:
        <ul>

          <li>For combined tables, Group/Ungroup Combined Table. This is not selected by default.</li>
          <li>Horizontal Gridlines: Select either Visible or Hidden. Horizontal gridlines are visible by default.</li>
          <li>Vertical Gridlines: select either Visible or Hidden. Vertical gridlines are hidden by default.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2><a id="add_map"></a>Adding a Map</h2>
    <p>You can add a map to a Workbench layout as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select a Component Type of Map.</li>
      <li>Enter a <span class="Bold">Tab Name</span>. In the finished layout, the tab name appears on a tab at the top of the area you are defining.</li>

This checkbox is selected by default. To remove the default hover fields deselect this checkbox. The default hover fields are listed in column 3 in the table below.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Defining Fields for Map Hover Text</h3>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: It is only necessary to define fields If you want to change which fields appear by default in the map hover text. Many fields are already included by default in the map hover text. So check the default hover before making any changes.</p>
    <p>You can change which fields appear in the map hover text for your workbench layouts as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To see both the default hover fields (column 3 below) and fields pre-defined in the PUBLIC screen set fields (column 2 below), select the Show Default Hover checkbox and leave the corresponding screen set field blank. This is the <span class="Bold">default</span>.</li>
      <li>To see both the default hover fields and the fields specified in a user-defined screen set, select the Show Default Hover checkbox and specify a screen set.</li>
      <li>To see only the fields pre-defined in the PUBLIC screen sets, clear the Show Default Hover checkbox and leave the corresponding screen set field blank.</li>
      <li>To see only the fields specified in a user-defined screen set, clear the Show Default Hover checkbox and specify a screen set.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If you leave the screen set field blank (which is the default), the PUBLIC screen set is automatically used. This will show the predefined fields see column 3 in the following table.</p>
    <p>The following table details each PUBLIC screen set that has fields with the Include in Hover text checkbox selected by default. The third column in this table lists the fields for each business object that are controlled by the <a href="#show_default_hover">Show Default Hover</a> checkbox. They are shown in the map hover if the Show Default Hover checkbox is selected.</p>
    <table title="The following table details each PUBLIC screen set that has fields with the Include in Hover text check box selected by default.">

    <h2><a id="Adding_a_Manager_Layout"></a>Adding a Manager Layout</h2>
    <p>You can add a view or edit manager layout to a workbench layout. This allows you to view or edit an OTM object such as a buy shipment or a GTM object such as a license.</p>
    <p>The manager layout component populates when a record is selected on an associated table. The manager layout component displays the data for any object based on the screen set assigned to either the view or edit control of the associated table where the object is selected. For example, when a specific shipment is selected on a shipment table the manager layout displays the buy shipment view or edit manager page as defined on the screen set.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: It is recommended that your manager layouts have as few fields as possible! A minimal manager layout will be easier to navigate in the relatively small space available on a workbench layout and it will load faster.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: A main table must already exist on the layout prior to adding this component type.</p>
    <p>You can add a manager layout component as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select a <span class="Bold">Component Type</span> of Manager Layout.</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Select an <span class="Bold">Associated Table</span>. The list of associated tables is populated based on the main tables already defined on the layout. For example, if your layout contains buy shipment and driver main tables, you see 2 checkboxes: Buy Shipment and Driver.</li>
