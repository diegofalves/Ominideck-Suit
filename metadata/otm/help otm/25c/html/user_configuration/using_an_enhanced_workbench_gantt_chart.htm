  <div role="main">
    <p>This page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Configuration and Administration &gt; User Configuration &gt; Enhanced Workbench</span>. Select an existing layout. The Workbench Layout list will show both enhanced and legacy layout IDs. The legacy layout IDs are marked with an asterisk. While these layouts can be viewed in the Enhanced Workbench, they cannot be edited. Any legacy layouts that you view in the Enhanced Workbench uses all of the enhanced layout icons. You can convert legacy layouts to enhanced layouts using the <a href="workbench_managerr.htm">Workbench Manager</a> actions.</p>
    <p>After you design layouts for a workbench, you can use the workbench by selecting the layout from the drop-down list.</p>
    <p>The Gantt chart components are a visual representation of the assignments in a scheduling format. Each row in the Gantt chart is an assignment, and it displays the shipments/location resource assigned to the assignment/appointment in the time period. The Gantt chart components available are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Driver Gantt</li>
      <li>Shipment Gantt</li>
      <li>Work Assignment Gantt</li>
      <li>Dock Scheduling Gantt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The default date range of the Gantt chart is today and the next 7 days. The red line on the chart indicates the current date and time.</p>
    <p>The Gantt chart pane interacts with the other panes used in a workbench layout. The Gantt chart pane is divided into two sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <span class="Bold">assignment section</span> appears on the left. It displays the driver ID, work assignment ID, or dock door (location resource ID), earliest start time (for driver only), and latest end time (for driver only).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Earliest start time and latest end time columns are only available on the Driver Gantt chart. The early start time is the start time of the earliest shipment displayed in the Gantt chart for this assignment. The latest end time is the last end time for the last shipment displayed in the Gantt chart for this assignment.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The other section is the <span class="Bold">Gantt chart section</span>. In that section, the assignment time usage is graphically displayed in the chart. The ability to drag and drop differs between the Driver Gantt, the Shipment Gantt, the Work Assignment Gantt, and the Dock Scheduling Gantt.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Appointment Display String (Shipment and Dock Scheduler only)</h3>
    <p>Appointment numbers are automatically generated for every new appointment. If appointments are scheduled across different resource types, all created appointments will have the same confirmation number. When you reschedule an appointment the system keeps the same appointment number unless you have configured the appointment display string to do otherwise. You canÂ can configure appointment display string in the following places:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>parameter of <a href="../planning/power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm#appointment_display_string">APPOINTMENT DISPLAY STRING</a> defined via user access which when set applies to that user.</li>
      <li>parameter of APPOINTMENT DISPLAY STRING defined on domain settings which when set applies to users of that domain.</li>

      <li><a href="#gantt_params">Gantt parameters</a> as detailed above.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a id="Actions"></a>Actions</h2>
    <p>The Driver Gantt, the Shipment Gantt, the Work Assignment Gantt, and the Dock Scheduling Gantt contain two action menus. The actions that appear on these menus are controlled by the screen sets specified when you create the Gantt component.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Driver Gantt contains a Driver Actions menu and a Shipment Actions menu. The actions are controlled by the <a href="adding_content_enhanced_workbench_layout.htm#Adding_a_Gantt_Chart">driver screen set and shipment screen set</a> specified when you created this region.</li>
      <li>The Shipment Gantt contains an Actions menu which displays the Shipment Actions and Shipment Stop Action menus. The actions are controlled by the <a href="adding_content_enhanced_workbench_layout.htm#Shipment_Gantt">shipment screen set and shipment stop screen set</a> specified when you created this region.</li>
      <li>The Work Assignment Gantt contains an Actions menu which displays a Work Assignment Actions menu and a Shipment Actions menu. The actions are controlled by the <a href="adding_content_enhanced_workbench_layout.htm#wa_gantt_chart">work assignment screen set and the shipment screen set</a> specified when you created this region.</li>
      <li>The Dock Scheduling Gantt contains a Location Resource Actions menu and an Appointment Actions menu. The actions are controlled by the <a href="adding_content_enhanced_workbench_layout.htm#dock_sched_gantt">location resource screen set and appointment screen set</a> specified when you created this region.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a id="Driver_Gantt_Chart"></a>Driver Gantt Chart</h2>
    <p>The Driver Gantt chart is a visual representation of the driver assignments in a scheduling format. Each row in the Gantt chart is a driver, and it displays the shipments assigned to this driver in the time period selected.</p>
    <h3>Driver-specific Actions</h3>
    <p>Actions are run against shipments that appear in the Gantt chart pane, not the driver table pane. To select a shipment, click on the bar in the chart. To clear the selection, click on the same shipment bar. When in the Gantt chart, you are working on a shipment and any actions are shipment actions or will run against the shipment.</p>
    <p>The following actions are under the Shipment Actions menu or can be accessed via SmartLinks within the Gantt:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../planning/shipment_manager/manage_assignment.htm"><span class="Bold">Commit Driver Assignment</span></a></li>
      <li><a href="../planning/shipment_manager/fleet_unassign.htm"><span class="Bold">Unassign Driver from Shipment</span></a></li>
      <li><a href="../planning/shipment_manager/manage_assignment.htm"><span class="Bold">Uncommit Driver Assignment</span></a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Action Check</h3>
    <p>For <a href="../user_access/action_checks.htm">action checks</a>Â on the Assign Shipment to Driver, use the audit action ID of ASSIGN SHIPMENT TO DRIVER.</p>
    <h2><a id="Shipment_Gantt_Chart"></a>Shipment Gantt Chart</h2>
    <p>The Shipment Gantt chart is a visual representation of the <a href="../planning/shipment_manager/multi_create_shipments/multi_create_shipmnt.htm">buy shipments</a> in a scheduling format. Each row in the Gantt chart is a shipment. You can click on the arrow to expand the shipment tree see the shipment stop locations. Each time you expand the tree you see the Gantt changes to show more information.</p>
    <h2><a id="Work_Assignment_Gantt_Chart"></a>Work Assignment Gantt Chart</h2>
    <p>The Work Assignment Gantt chart is a visual representation of the <a href="../asset_mgt/resource/work_assignment.htm">work assignments</a> in a scheduling format. Each row in the Gantt chart is a work assignment. You can also view work assignments based on the resource scheduling instance. You can click on the arrow to expand the work assignment tree, click once again to see the shipments, and finally click again on each shipment to see the shipment stops. Each time you expand the tree you see the Gantt changes to show more information.</p>
    <h3>Right-click Action</h3>
    <p>You can right-click on a shipment and run the <a href="../asset_mgt/resource/remove_shipment.htm">Remove Shipment</a> (from work assignment) action.</p>
    <h3>Action Check</h3>
    <p>For <a href="../user_access/action_checks.htm">action checks</a>, use the audit action ID of ADD SHIPMENT ON WA.</p>
    <h2><a id="dock_gantt_chart"></a>Dock Scheduling Gantt Chart</h2>
    <p>The Dock Scheduling Gantt chart is a visual representation of the <a href="../asset_mgt/resource/work_assignment.htm">appointments</a> in a scheduling format. Each row in the Gantt chart is a location resource (dock door), and it displays the appointments assigned to this location resource in the time period selected with the location&#39;s time zone.Â </p>
    <p>You can use an appointment rule set for each location resourceÂ based on the shipment stop estimated arrival time to determine the compatible location resources. This behavior is turned off by default. Set the <a href="../properties/glog/appointment.property.htm#glog.appointment.workbench.filterLocResBasedOnApptRuleSet">propertyÂ glog.appointment.workbench.filterLocResBasedOnApptRuleSet</a> to true to enable this behavior.</p>
    <p>If you have a shipment stop table pane, you can select the Add to Gantt option button in the table row to add the record to the Gantt chart, or you can run the Add to Gantt action. When you select the option button, the Gantt chart loads with corresponding location resources and appointments if any. When there are no appointments for the selected shipment stop, the Gantt chart start time is minus (-) one day to the estimated arrival or planned arrival of the shipment stop and Gantt chart end time is plus (+) one day to the estimated arrival or planned arrival of the shipment stop. When there is an appointment for the selected shipment stop, the Gantt chart start time is minus (-) one day to the appointment start time and Gantt chart end time is plus (+) one day to the appointment end time.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: The dock scheduling Gantt chart supports one location at a time. So you can only select one shipment stop to show on the Gantt chart.</p>
    <h3>Actions</h3>
    <h4>Location Resource Actions</h4>
    <p>Location Resource ActionsÂ Appointment Actions are run against the location resources that appear in the Gantt chart section.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="Bold">Create Appointment</span>: When you click the Create Appointment action, the <a href="../warehouse_flow_mgmt/create_appointment.htm">create appointment</a> pop-up window appears. The values for the Pickup Location and Delivery Location fields will be the location of the selected shipment stop. The appointment is created on the most feasible location resource.</li>
      <li><span class="Bold">Block Resource</span>: When you click the Block Resource action, an appointment cannot be scheduled for that slot. While blocking the resource, you can add <a href="../general/remarks.htm">remarks</a> using the <span class="Bold">Add Remarks</span> checkbox.</li>
      <li><span class="Bold">Unblock Resource</span>: Select one or more blocked slots to unblock the slots so that you can schedule appointments.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Action Check</h5>
    <p>For <a href="../user_access/action_checks.htm">action checks</a>Â when using drag-and-drop to create or move an appointment, use the audit action ID of DOCK - DRAG AND DROP.</p>
    <h4>Appointment Actions</h4>
    <p>Appointment Actions are run against appointments that appear in the Gantt chart section. To select an appointment, click on the bar in the chart. To clear the selection, click on the same appointment bar. If an appointment is selected and a location resource row is selected, it may appear that the action is being run against the location resource, but it is really affecting the appointment.</p>
    <p>In addition to <a href="../warehouse_flow_mgmt/appointment_information_smartlinks.htm">appointment screen set actions</a>, the following actions are under the Appointment Actions menu:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="Bold">Add Remarks</span>: This action opens the Appointment Information Manager page where you can select a remark qualifier and add remark text.</li>
      <li><span class="Bold"><a href="../planning/shipment_manager/adjust_appointment_time.htm">Adjust Appointment Time</a></span></li>
      <li><span class="Bold">Change Appointment Activity Type</span>: This action specifies if the trailer scheduled for the appointment is attached to the truck (Live) or being dropped (Drop).</li>
      <li><span class="Bold">Find Next Available Appointment</span>: This action finds the next available appointment for the shipment stop. OTM finds the latest time between the current time at the location and the current appointment time and searches for the next best appointment from that time onwards. For example, letâs look at two scenarios, an appointment which is scheduled in the past and also in future.
        <ul>
          <li>Appointment before the current time at the location: Scenario 1 -Â If the current appointment time is at 10:00 A.M. on 15th June, 2017 and the current time at location is at 3:00 P.M. on 19th June, 2017. When you click Find Next Available Appointment, OTM searches for appointments from 19th June, 2017, 3:00 PM onwards and finds the latest appointment.</li>
          <li>Appointment after the current time at the location: Scenario 2 - If the current appointment time is at 10:00 AM on 25th June, 2017 and the current time at location is at 3:00 P.M. on 19th June, 2017.

For example: If the current appointment time is at 10:00 A.M. on 25th June, 2017 and the current time at location is at 3:00 P.M. on 19th June, 2017, and the best appointment after 3:00 P.M. on 19th June, 2017 is 4:00-5:00 P.M., so OTM selects this time for the best available appointment.
