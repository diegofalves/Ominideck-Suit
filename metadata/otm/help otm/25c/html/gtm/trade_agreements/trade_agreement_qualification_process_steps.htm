  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Trade Agreement Qualification: Process Steps</span></h1>
  <div role="main">
    <p>In terms of process, here are the following major steps for Trade Agreement Qualification on manufactured goods:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><span class="Bold"><a href="../trade/actions/qualify_for_trade_agreement.htm">Qualify for Trade Agreement</a></span>: For your manufactured goods that are eligible for certain trade agreements, you can analyze the bill of material, modeled as a trade item structure, to determine if it fully qualifies for a trade agreement based on the rules of origin. This action is available as a manual action from the UI or an agent action across multiple objects including item, trade item structure, item origin, and item qualification. It is also available as a process within Process Manager, enabling you to qualify an item or a trade item structure. In addition, you can run qualification against your trade transaction lines using a manual action or an agent action.<br>
        <br>
        Based on the rules of origin, GTM may prompt you to select an item attribute and/or conditions based on the rules of origin. When you trigger the action, GTM uses information such as country of origin, trade agreement, country of import, product classification and value data to determine if your finished good qualifies for a trade agreement.Â <br>
        <br>
        <span class="Bold">Note</span>: Certain trade agreements require that the Minimum Operations requirements must be met to perform qualification. Descartes sends that information as data during the Rules of Origin download. For each trade agreement that supports this check, there will be one Rules of Origin Rule Code with a type of MINOPS. GTMÂ checks to see if this rule code exists for a trade agreement, and will show the &quot;Minimum Operations Requirements&quot; checkbox only where the MINOPS rule code is present. This only applies to the web actions. For agent action and process manager, the Minimum Operations checkbox will always be displayed.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="Bold">Note: </span>If you are triggering qualification using an automation agent or as a bulk process, GTM may not know which item attribute and/or condition applies. In those cases, the Qualified status on the item qualification is set to REQUIRES REVIEW enabling you to know which records need attention so that you can add the necessary data to fully qualify the finished good. Â 
      </li>
      <li><span class="Bold">View Qualification Results</span>: Once qualification runs, an item qualification record is created and associated with the item origin. The status is set so that you know if the finished good qualifies, does not qualify, or requires review. You can view the item qualification record from the Item Qualification screen or from the Trade Details tab on the Item screen. Within each qualified item origin, the Trade Programs grid displays the details of the qualification.</li>
      <li><span class="Bold">View Qualification Report</span>: A qualification report is available enabling you to see the details of the qualification. You can click the View Qualification Report button to see the report. The report looks slightly different depending on if the qualification is based on the lowest leaf components or if the rollup principle is used.</li>
      <li><span class="Bold">Generate Certificate of Origin</span>: An <a href="../trade/actions/generate_certificate_of_origin.htm">action</a> is available enabling you to generate a Certificate of Origin for an item. To know more about data mapping details for the fields displayed in the Certificate of Origin, seeÂ <a href="coo_data_mapping_details.htm">Certificate of Origin: Data Mapping Details</a>.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="Bold">Note</span>:Â The Certificate of Origin will not be generated if the country of import and the trade agreement mentioned on the item qualification do not match with the details provided on the action Generate Certificate of Origin.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>In terms of process, here are the following major steps for Trade Agreement Qualification on manufactured goods:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><span class="Bold"><span class="Bold"><a href="../trade/actions/qualify_for_trade_agreement.htm">Qualify for Trade Agreement</a></span></span>: For your manufactured goods that are eligible for certain trade agreements, you can analyze the bill of material, modeled as a trade item structure, to determine if it fully qualifies for a trade agreement based on the rules of origin. This action is available as a manual action from the UI or an agent action across multiple objects including item, trade item structure, item origin, and item qualification. It is also available as a process within Process Manager, enabling you to qualify an item or a trade item structure.Â <br>
        <br>
        In addition, once your manufactured goods are qualified, Â  you can run qualification against your trade transaction lines using a manual action or an agent action. GTM uses the quantity and value data on the transaction line and the item structure bill of material to perform qualification. If an item qualification already exists, GTM uses it. Else, GTM runs the qualification logic on the trade transaction lines.<br>
        <br>
        Based on the rules of origin, GTM may prompt you to select an item attribute and/or conditions based on the rules of origin. When you trigger the action, GTM uses information such as country of origin, trade agreement, country of import, product classification and value data to determine if your finished good qualifies for a trade agreement.<br>

        <br>
        On the trade transaction line, the qualification results are available in the transaction lines qualification record including the status, attributes/conditions and values.
      </li>
      <li><span class="Bold">View Qualification Report</span>: A qualification report is available enabling you to see the details of the qualification. You can click the View Qualification Report button on the item qualification or the transaction line qualification to see the report.

      <li><span class="Bold">Generate Certificate of Origin</span>: An <a href="../trade/actions/generate_certificate_of_origin.htm">action</a>Â is available enabling you to generate a Certificate of Origin for an item.
