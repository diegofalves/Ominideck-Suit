  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Unassign Order Buy/Sell</span></h1>
  <div role="main">
    <p>This action is accessed via the <span class="Bold">Order Release Manager</span> (accessed via <span class="Bold">Order Management &gt; Order Release &gt; Order Release</span>). Click <span class="Bold">Actions</span>. Then select <span class="Bold">Order Management &gt; Unassign Order Release &gt;</span> <span class="Bold">Unassign Order Buy</span> or <span class="Bold">Sell</span>.</p>
    <p>Use this action to unassign an order release from a shipment and automatically delete any related order movements that exist for the order. Appropriate order release statuses are updated as a result of this action. This action takes all lines from their packed ship unit. If all lines for a ship unit are deleted, then the ship unit will also be deleted.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If you wish to use this action and the shipment has a status of ENROUTE_ENROUTE, set the <a href="../../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm">IGNORE ACTUAL TIMES DURING ADD OR UNASSIGN ORDER parameter</a> to true.</p>
    <p>When a shipment has only no-activity stop, the shipment should be removed. The exceptions are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>schedule instance shipment</li>
      <li>consol shipment</li>
      <li>Shipment is_permanent flag is true</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The property <a href="../../../properties/glog/business.property.htm#unassignOrders.loadLimitedGraph">glog.business.unassignOrders.loadLimitedGraph</a> controls how many shipments and order movements are brought in during the unassign order process. When true, OTM will bring in only the shipments that actually have the to-be-unassigned order releases and the order movements on those shipments. Note that only these shipments will be re-driven. This is recommended only when you are sure that no other shipments need to be re-driven as the result of this action. The default is false.</p>
    <p>The property <a href="../../../properties/glog/business.property.htm#consolidation.bulkplan.relaxOrderBundlePickupWindow">glog.business.consolidation.bulkplan.relaxOrderBundlePickupWindow</a> (when true),allows an order release with the date emphasis set to BOTH and a pickup window in the past to be unassigned.</p>
    <p>The property <a href="../../../properties/glog/business.property.htm#orderActions.unassign.redriveShipmentWithOptimalStartTime">glog.business.orderActions.unassign.redriveShipmentWithOptimalStartTime</a> determines if, when unassigning an order release, OTM will redrive the partial shipments with the original shipment&#39;s start time that is being unassigned (default is false, existing default behavior). When set to true, OTM will redrive the shipments using the optimal start time in the unassign process.</p>
    <h3>Fleet Shipments</h3>
    <p>This action also works for fleet shipments (shipments with fleet resources assigned) with some differences.</p>
    <p>If the order release being removed is the only order release for the stop, the stop might need to be deleted. However, the stop will not be deleted when a fleet resource activity is being performed on the stop. For example, if the order release pickup is also the driver start location, this action will keep the stop and change the stop type from pickup to NFR (non-freight related).</p>
    <p>If this action would result in removal of the last freight stop, this action will fail if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the last freight stop = the last shipment stop and the driver assigned to this shipment has a subsequent shipment assignment</li>
      <li>the last freight stop has a subsequent equipment drop-off</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If this is the last order release on the shipment, it cannot be unassigned. You need to run the appropriate unassign fleet resource action first.</p>
    <p>As a result of this unassignment, the shipment and it&#39;s downstream shipments will be redriven.</p>
    <h3>In-transit Shipments</h3>
    <p>Order releases of stops already visited/actualized cannot be unassigned.</p>
    <p>The sequence of the actualized stop remains fixed after the unassign action.</p>
    <p>If only the arrival time has been actualized, the order releases picked up on that stop can be unassigned. However, if that is the only order release on the stop, and unassign would remove the stop, the action will fail since the stop has already been visited.</p>
    <p>As a result of this unassignment, the shipment and it&#39;s downstream shipments will be redriven.</p>
    <p>The property <a href="../../../properties/glog/shipmentstatus.property.htm#maxQueryResults">glog.shipmentstatus.maxQueryResults</a> controls the maximum number of in-transit shipment records. This is used from the stock keeping unit (SKU) data to navigate over to in-transit shipments.</p>
    <h3>Work Assignments</h3>
    <p>The Unassign Order - Buy action unassigns orders from shipments which belong to a work assignment. When the Status value of the work assignment is <a href="../../../asset_mgt/resource/work_assignment.htm#WA_DRIVER_ASSIGNMEN_Assigned">WA_DRIVER_ASSIGNMENT_ASSIGNED</a>, orders will not be unassigned.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: During bulk plan, same process will be followed to unassign orders from shipments which belong to a work assignment.</p>
    <p>When you run the Unassign Order - Buy action:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Entire work assignment - all orders on all shipments on a work assignment will be unassigned and all shipments will be deleted. OTM will disband the entire work assignment.</li>
      <li>Entire shipment - all orders on a shipment will be unassigned and few shipments which belong to a work assignment are deleted but not all shipments of the work assignment. The work assignment with remaining shipments will be updated.
        <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If number of remaining shipments in the work assignment is less than the <a href="../../power_data/planning/logic_configuration_resource_scheduler.htm#WA_MIN_SHIPMENTS_IN_TOUR">WA MIN SHIPMENTS IN TOUR</a> logic parameter, then the work assignment feasibility code is set to WORK_ASSIGNMENT_LOGIC_PARAMETER_INFEASIBLE.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Partial shipment - few orders will be unassigned from a shipment which belongs to a work assignment but not all orders of the shipment. Therefore, the shipment will not be deleted. The work assignment will be updated.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let&#39;s look at the following example:</p>
    <p>Consider there are two work assignments such as WA1 which consists of two shipments. Each shipment has one order release, Order A is on one shipment and Order B is on another. Similarly WA2 consists of two shipments, each has one order release, Order C and Order D.</p>
    <p>When you select Order A and Order B Â from the WA1 work assignment and run the Unassign Order â Buy action, OTM deletes two shipments and disbands the entire WA1 work assignment.</p>
    <p>When you select Order A from WA1 work assignment and Order C from WA2 work assignment and run the Unassign Order â Buy action, OTM deletes one shipment from each work assignment and updates the two work assignments WA1 and WA2.</p>
