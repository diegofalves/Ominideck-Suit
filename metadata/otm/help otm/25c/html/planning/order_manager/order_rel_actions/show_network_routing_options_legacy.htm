  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Order Release Show Network Routing Options</span></h1>
  <div role="main">
    <p>This action is accessed via <a href="../modify_order_rel_r.htm">Order Release actions</a>.</p>
    <p>This action presents a list of routes, which are expandable (on the same screen) to show each leg of the chosen itinerary along with the best option (service provider, start time, etc). This allows for the return of several different paths through a network leg, if one of the itinerary legs has a network leg. This action considers both itineraries and routing networks, and uses network routing to determine what possible routes are available.</p>
    <p>Use this action when you want to create a shipment (buy or sell), and want to review and assign a route from a valid list generated by Oracle Transportation Management.</p>
    <p>There are several stages and options associated with using this action, all of which are outlined below. The process begins by selecting an <a href="../or_edit.htm">Order Release</a> and using the action <span class="Bold">Show Network Routing Options</span> under Create Buy Shipment or Create Sell Shipment.</p>
    <p>This action only shows possible routing options, it does not select one. Also, it does not consider other existing order volume when determining the possible routes.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The action <a href="valid_itinerary.htm">Show Routing Options</a> only considers itineraries and not routing networks and does not use network routing.</li>
      <li>The action <a href="show_network_routing_options_ocean.htm">Show Network Routing Options - Ocean</a> focuses on ocean shipments with the primary leg being the ocean leg.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The parameter <a href="../../power_data/planning/logic_configuration_network_routing.htm#USE_ROUTING_CONSTRAINT_FOR_PORT_SELECTION">USE ROUTING CONSTRAINT FOR PORT SELECTION</a> should be off (false) when using Show Network Routing Options.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span><span>:</span> When two or more orders have different <a href="../../itinerary_manager/routing_constraint_manager.htm">routing constraints</a>, that are different, but overlap, just one may be chosen. For example, order 1 has a routing constraint A that says &quot;use Dublin and Lisbon&quot;, and order 2 has a routing constraint B that says &quot;use Lisbon&quot;, OTM will check compatibility. Here, they are compatible. OTM does not combine routing constraints A &amp; B so that the result says &quot;use Dublin and Lisbon&quot;. Instead, OTM will just choose one of them, and in this case may choose &quot;use Lisbon&quot;, and end up using something other than Dublin, such as Cork.</p>
    <h2><a name="routing_constraints" id="routing_constraints"></a>Routing Constraints</h2>
    <p>This provides an additional way to apply routing constraints other than the <a href="../../itinerary_manager/routing_constraint_manager.htm">Routing Constraint Manager</a>. If you select the checkbox &#39;Ignore Routing Constraints from Order&#39;, then you are able to specify a routing constraint override to be used.</p>
    <p>The routing constraints populate automatically based on the order release constraints if all the order releases selected have the same values for the constraints.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select routing constraints. A page appears that allows you to limit the valid itineraries returned by Oracle Transportation Management to just those that have matching values to what you enter. Constraint options include:
        <ol>
          <li><span class="Bold">Parameter Set ID</span> will be populated here if the Planning Criteria screen is turned on and you have selected Parameter Set ID from the Planning Criteria screen.</li>
          <li>The <span class="Bold">Ignore Routing Constraints from Order</span> checkbox allows you to ignore the routing constraints that are defined by orders.</li>
          <li><span class="Bold">Routing Constraints Override</span> field is only visible when Ignore Routing Constraints from Order checkbox is selected.</li>
          <li>IfÂ the <span class="Bold">Always Use This Location</span> field is populated, it imposes a new constraint in addition to routing constraints of the order or override.</li>
          <li>Select any additional constraints. These are constraints for primary leg only.
            <ul>
              <li><a href="../../power_data/rates_and_codes/transport_modes.htm">Transport Mode</a> and <a href="../../power_data/service_provider/mode_profile.htm">Mode Profile</a></li>
              <li><a href="../../location_manager/create_sp.htm">Service Provider</a> and <a href="../../power_data/service_provider/service_provider_profile.htm">Service Provider Profile</a></li>
              <li><a href="../../equip_manager/create_equip_group.htm">Equipment Group</a> and <a href="../../equip_manager/create_equip_grp_pro.htm">Equipment Group Profile</a></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>If you want Oracle Transportation Management to return all valid routes except certain ones, then enter that value in the appropriate field and check the corresponding <span class="Bold">Exclude</span> checkbox. If you do not enter any constraints, all valid routes are returned.</li>
      <li>When complete, click the <span class="Bold">Show Options</span> button. This will calculate and display the options of all valid itineraries/routes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Replan</h2>
    <p>Replan allows you to reroute a part of planned orders to a new path. When you run the Show Network Routing Options action, OTM displays the planned route for the selected orders. If you select a leg to replan,Â the path till the selected leg will be fixed, and the remaining path can be planned onto a different route.Â </p>
    <p>When you click <span class="Bold">Replan</span>, OTM allows you to update or continue with the existingÂ <a href="#routing_constraints">Routing Constraints</a>.Â </p>
    <p>TheÂ <a href="#valid_itineraries">Valid Itineraries</a>Â pageÂ displays the routing options of all the itineraries that have the same fixed path (leg) that you selected to replan. When you expand each itinerary, the fixed leg details will be grayed out.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>:<br>
      - If there is a split at any point in the planned route, OTM does not allow you to replanÂ beyond that point.<br>
      - If the first leg is only on order movements, OTM does not allow you to replan the order.<br>
      - If some of the order movements on a leg are not planned, OTM does not allow you to replan from the leg that is not planned and its downstream legs. For example, consider few shipments on leg 1. If some order movements on leg 2 are not planned, you will not be able to replan from leg 2 and the downstream legs.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>:Â If you want to view the shipment status of each shipment under Legs in the Planned Route, set the property, <a href="../../../properties/glog/webserver.property.htm#glog.webserver.networkrouting.replan.displayShipmentStatusType">glog.webserver.networkrouting.replan.displayShipmentStatusType</a>.</p>
    <h3>For multiple order releases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>OTM allows you to replan only when:
        <ul>
          <li>all the selected order releases are planned.</li>
          <li>all the selected order releases have the same source and destination.Â </li>
          <li>all the selected order releases have a common route from the source to an intermediate location.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>OTM does not allow you to replan:
        <ul>
          <li>if the route of the orders are split at the source location as there is no common path.Â </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When the order is split at any point, OTM displays the remaining route as sub-routes.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: OTM allows you to replan to different itineraries.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: To replan an order, the property,Â <a href="../../../properties/glog/business.property.htm#glog.business.networkrouting.allowReplan">glog.business.networkrouting.allowReplan,</a>Â is set to true by default. To disable the replan option, set the property to false.</p>
    <h2><a name="valid_itineraries" id="valid_itineraries"></a>Valid Itineraries</h2>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Itineraries which are time infeasible are also returned. They are indicated as such by an hour glass icon with a red &quot;x&quot;.</p>
    <p>A Valid Itineraries page appears that displays all the valid itineraries based on standard search criteria and any constraints you identified in the previous step. It shows not only different itinerary options, but also different paths through the same routing network. If there are multiple possible itineraries, all applicable itineraries are displayed. To view details about each itinerary, click the appropriate ID.</p>
    <p>You can control the number of paths generated by using the <a href="../../power_data/planning/logic_configuration_network_routing.htm#max_num">MAX NUM SHORTEST PATHS</a> parameter.</p>
    <p>Some of the itineraries on the list may not build a feasible shipment. Since it is not optimal to put non-valid itineraries through the planning logic, it only shows itineraries that may work, but still may not pass through the planning criteria.</p>
    <p>The Routing Locations shows the order source and destination and any throughpoints used on this path. The Routing Cost shows the cost computed within network routing for this path. Since it is using the abstracted costs calculated when rating the network, it will not be as accurate as the actual costs on the next page. Similarly, &#39;Routing Time&#39; shows the transit times computed within network routing for this path. It will not be as accurate as the actual transit times on the next page.</p>
    <p>If there are more than four locations in a route, Oracle Transportation Management displays &quot;...&quot; between the first two locations and the last two locations.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If you know what itinerary you want, and you know that it is feasible, you can select it and click <span class="Bold">Optimize</span> to build the shipment with that itinerary.Â When the value of the parameterÂ <a href="../../power_data/planning/logic_configuration_network_routing.htm#save_order_movements">&#39;Save Order Movements</a><a href="../../power_data/planning/logic_configuration_network_routing.htm#save_order_movements">&#39;</a>Â is not set as &quot;Build Shipments and Save All Order Movements&quot;, only unplanned order movements will be created without building shipments.Â </li>
      <li>If you want to see if an itinerary can build a shipment, select the itineraries you are interested in or leave them all unselected for them all to run, and click the <span class="Bold">Show Options</span> button. This brings up the <a href="valid_itinerary.htm#show_routing_options">Show Routing Options</a> page.</li>
      <li>You can also click the <span class="Bold">Refine Constraints</span> button to go back to the <a href="valid_itinerary.htm#routing_constraints">previous Routing Constraints page</a> in order to edit routing constraints.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>:Â OTM displays the consol and ground schedule details if the propertyÂ  <a href="../../../properties/glog/webserver.property.htm#glog.webserver.networkrouting.displayConsolDetails">glog.webserver.networkrouting.displayConsolDetails</a> is set to true.</p>
    <h2><a name="show_routing_options" id="show_routing_options"></a>Show Routing Options</h2>
    <p>All the valid routes from the previous page appear in the Show Routing Options page. Any itineraries that could not be built into feasible shipments are labeled accordingly.</p>
    <p>All itineraries that can be built into feasible shipments are listed in order of cost and show shipment start and end times. You can use the Expand icon to drill down to see shipment details.</p>
    <p>This shows the particular options for one selected path. It shows the cheapest service provider that has capacity. The &#39;Total Actual Cost&#39; and &#39;Transit Time&#39; values are accurate for the actual shipment to be built.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select the itinerary that you want to use to create the shipment, and click <span class="Bold">OK</span>.
        <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If the order release you are working with already belongs to a shipment, it is removed from that shipment and resent through the planning logic. Potentially, it can be put onto a new shipment.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Click the <span class="Bold">Refine Options</span> button to further specify the rate record, rate offering, and equipment groups combination for the shipment.</li>
      <li>Click <span class="Bold">Itineraries</span> to go to the previous page to view valid itineraries.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>:Â OTM displays the consol and ground schedule details if the propertyÂ  <a href="../../../properties/glog/webserver.property.htm#glog.webserver.networkrouting.displayConsolDetails">glog.webserver.networkrouting.displayConsolDetails</a> is set to true.</p>
    <h2><a name="refine_options" id="refine_options"></a>Refine Options</h2>
    <p>Use the Refine Options page to specify the exact cost, rate offering, rate record, and equipment group used to build a shipment. You may want to use this page to select a carrier that is more expensive, but can handle your shipment on fewer pieces of equipment.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select an option to <span class="Bold">sort</span> the data, such as by transit time instead of by cost.</li>
      <li>Select the combination that best suits the needs of your shipment.</li>
      <li>Click <span class="Bold">Save</span> to build the shipment.</li>
