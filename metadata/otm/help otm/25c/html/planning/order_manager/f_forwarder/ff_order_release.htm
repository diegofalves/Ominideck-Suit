    <div role="main">
      <p>This page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Brokerage and Forwarding &gt; Booking &gt; Freight Forwarding</span>.</p>
      <p>A freight forwarder is a company that handles freight for another company. They are often used when shipments must cross international borders and certain international protocols must be observed. International freight forwarders are well-versed in the paperwork required by international shipments, therefore the company that contracts them does not need to worry about handling such complicated freight issues.</p>
      <p>This page displays the attributes that you can define for each order release. Many of the attributes that appear here are the same as those that are available on the standard <a href="../or_edit.htm">Order Release</a> manager.</p>
      <p>The following properties help you configure the process:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="../../../properties/glog/freight_forwarding.property.htm#glog.freight_forwarding.showBuyerSection">glog.freight_forwarding.showBuyerSection</a>: Determines whether the buyer template section of the freight forwarding template page appears when creating a new order release from freight forwarder.</li>
        <li><a href="../../../properties/glog/freight_forwarding.property.htm#glog.freight_forwarding.showCustomerSection">glog.freight_forwarding.showCustomerSection</a>: Determines whether the customer template section of the freight forwarding template page appears when creating a new order release from freight forwarder.</li>
        <li><a href="../../../properties/glog/freight_forwarding.property.htm#glog.freight_forwarding.showDomainSection">glog.freight_forwarding.showDomainSection</a>: Determines whether the domain template section of the freight forwarding template page appears when creating a new order release from freight forwarder.</li>
        <li><a href="../../../properties/glog/freight_forwarding.property.htm#glog.freight_forwarding.showTemplateSection">glog.freight_forwarding.showTemplateSection</a>: Determines whether the standard template section of the freight forwarding template page appears when creating a new order release from freight forwarder.</li>
        <li><a href="../../../properties/glog/freight_forwarding.property.htm#glog.freight_forwarding.show_template">glog.freight_forwarding.show_template</a>: Determines whether you can add different types of templates to an order when creating an order release from freight forwarder. This property needs to be set to true if you want any type of template to be shown from the freight forwarder template page when creating a new order release from freight forwarder.</li>
        <li>
          <p><a href="../../../properties/glog/freight_forwarding.property.htm#glog.freight_forwarding.show_primary_sell_leg_info">glog.freight_forwarding.show_primary_sell_leg_info</a>: Determines if the Primary Leg Info button displays in the Freight Forwarding manager.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a name="identification" id="identification"></a>General Information</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter an <span class="Bold">Order Release ID</span> to identify the order.</li>
        <li>If the order release was created from a <span class="Bold"><a href="../quote/quote_identification.htm">Quote</a></span>, then the Quote ID it was created from will appear here.</li>
        <li>If the shipper is considered a <span class="Bold"><a href="../ob_other_attributes.htm#Known">Known Shipper</a></span> in Oracle Transportation Management, mark the checkbox.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Create Date</span> is the date the order release originated. The Create Date is only displayed when editing an order release.</li>
        <li>Select Import or Export as a <span class="Bold">Move Perspective</span> to further identify the type of order release. Each Perspective has its own set or pre-populated Involved Party Qualifiers that are associated with the move type selected. However, you can edit and delete the qualifiers if needed. You can predefine <a href="../../power_data/25_general/move_perspective.htm">move perspectives</a> in Power Data.</li>
        <li>Use the <span class="Bold"><a href="../../power_data/order_management/order_types.htm">Order Type</a></span> to categorize and group like orders such, customer orders, replenishment orders, or any other distinguishing characteristic that you want.</li>
        <li>Mark the <span class="Bold">Use as Template</span> checkbox and designate a <span class="Bold">Template Type</span> to use this order as a template. The following template types exist:
          <ul>
            <li><span class="Bold">Buyer</span> - Designating the order release as a <a href="../../location_manager/buyer_manager/buyer_template.htm">Buyer Template</a> makes the template available when selecting a template in the Buyer Manager.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Customer</span> - Designating the order release as a <a href="../../../user_management/customer_settings.htm">Customer Template</a> makes the template available when selecting a template in the Customer Manager.</li>

            <li><span class="Bold">Service</span> - Select <a href="../../power_data/25_general/services.htm">Service</a> to create a service template and automatically assign services to orders. Service template is based on Buyer (destination) and service and can be further constrained by a source location and/or packaged item.
              <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: When defining a Service type of template, you will not be able to save the template if ship units and/or services are defined on the template.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Standard</span> - If the template is not specific to buyer, customer or service, select Standard.</li>

        <li>The <span class="Bold">Commercial Payment Terms</span> define the commercial terms of payment between the shipper and the shippers customer (For information only). <a href="../../power_data/25_payment/pay_method_codes.htm">Payment method codes</a> with the type of &quot;commercial&quot; or &quot;both&quot; are displayed here.</li>
        <li>View the current status of the order release by clicking on the <span class="Bold"><a href="../order_rel_status.htm">Status</a></span> button.</li>
        <li>Set the initial <span class="Bold"><a href="../../shipment_manager/shared_tabs/ship_mgrs_financials.htm#INCO">Incoterms</a></span> and <span class="Bold">Incoterm Location</span> for the order release. If the terms change, enter in the <span class="Bold">Final Incoterms</span> and <span class="Bold">Final Incoterm location</span> (For information only).</li>
        <li>Select an <a href="../../power_data/order_management/order_configuration.htm">Order Configuration</a> from the <span class="Bold">Order Configuration</span> drop-down list.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="involved" id="involved"></a>Involved Parties</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Use this section of the page to assign <a href="../../../general/order_involved_party.htm">involved party</a> locations to the order release.</li>
        <li>If you select a <span class="Bold">Move Perspective</span> (see step five in the above General section), Oracle Transportation Management automatically sets standard involved parties qualifiers that are associated with the type of move perspective you selected. You need to set the involved party location for each party qualifier before continuing to the next page.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold"><a href="../order_release_other_attributes.htm#Consolidation">Consolidation Type</a></span> for the order (for information only).</li>
        <li>By selecting a <span class="Bold">Transport Mode</span> you <a href="../order_plan_constraints.htm#Transportation">limit</a> what mode Oracle Transportation Management can select when building a shipment.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Date Available By</span> field defines the earliest time the order can be picked up. The <span class="Bold">Date Deliver By</span> field defines the latest date the order can be delivered.</li>
        <li>Set the Filter fields (Source Location, Plan From Location, Destination Location, Plan to Location) to indicate the type of locations you will be describing. Â For example, setting the Source Location Filter to Port will result in only ports populating the Source Location drop-down selection list.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: These filters do not persist, that is, they only exist to cut down the number of locations you must search through when creating an order release.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Source</span> and <span class="Bold"><a href="../or_edit.htm#locations">Destination Location</a></span> for the order.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold"><a href="../or_edit.htm#Plan">Plan From</a></span> and <span class="Bold">To Locations</span> for the order.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold"><a href="../or_edit.htm#port">Port of Load</a></span> and <span class="Bold">Discharge</span> for the order.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: When editing the order release, the Location names for all the locations are displayed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Optionally, assign <span class="Bold"><a href="../../rate_manager/accessorial_defined.htm">Accessorial</a></span> or <span class="Bold">Special Service</span> costs to an order.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold"><a href="../../../field_definitions/bundling_type.htm">Bundling Type</a></span> to designate how the order is to be grouped with other orders.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="Bold"><a href="../../../general/location_override.htm">Set Location Overrides</a></span> to change specific location content for any location that is populated on the order.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="Bold"><a href="../../../general/set_load_unload_points.htm">Set Load/Unload Points</a></span> to change specific load /unload points for a specific location.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="access" id="access"></a>Accessorials</h2>
      <p>Add <a href="../../rate_manager/accessorial_defined.htm">accessorials</a> to the order.</p>
      <h2><a name="spec_srvs" id="spec_srvs"></a>Special Services</h2>
      <p>Add <a href="../../rate_manager/accessorial_defined.htm">special services</a> to the order.</p>
      <h2><a name="order" id="order"></a>Order Content</h2>
      <p>You decide whether you want to describe the order in terms of ship units or line items. When creating an order release in Freight Forwarder, Oracle Transportation Management initially defaults to ship units, however you can change your domain&#39;s behavior by changing your <a href="../../../user_preferences/setting_user_preferences.htm">user preference</a>.</p>
      <h2><a name="addequipment" id="addequipment"></a>Add Equipment by Equipment Group</h2>
      <p>This section allows you to add equipment by group. For example, you can add 10 pieces at once and they will all be listed automatically in the details section below.</p>
      <h2><a name="equipment" id="equipment"></a>Equipment Detail</h2>
      <p>Freight Forwarder has different views when adding specific equipment to an order initially or when editing an order after creation.</p>
      <p>When you identify equipment on the order, Oracle Transportation Management skips container optimization process when building shipments. Also, the container details are copied to the shipment. Any equipment specified here must be assigned to a ship unit via the <a href="../../../field_definitions/order_release_equipment.htm">Order Release Equipment</a> field on the <a href="ff_ship_unit.htm">ship unit</a>.</p>
      <h3>Adding Specific Equipment to a New Order</h3>
      <p>Use this section of the page if you want to constrain the order release to ship on specific equipment. The equipment that you enter here will override any equipment specified on either the parent order base or itinerary (in the Equipment Group Profile).</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold"><a href="adding_equipment_to_an_order.htm">Equipment Detail</a></span> option button and click on <span class="Bold"><a href="adding_equipment_to_an_order.htm">New Equipment</a></span> to add individual pieces of equipment to an order. This allows you to enter specific pieces for the order.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Equipment Summary</span> and click on New Equipment to enter total piece count for an individual type of equipment. Using this method streamlines equipment entry but does not allow you to identify specific equipment. To do this enter the <span class="Bold">Equipment Group</span> needed for this order. Next, enter the equipment piece count you need for this order in the <span class="Bold">Equipment Group Count</span> field.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: When changing between summary and details equipment options Oracle Transportation Management will reload the order release page.</p>
      <h3>Editing Existing Equipment</h3>
      <p>Editing an existing order release displays the Summary of the equipment already assigned to the order along with individual Equipment Detail. The summary displays the equipment and its count. The Detail describes each individual piece of equipment. You can edit or delete the described pieces if needed. You can also assign more equipment to the order by clicking on <span class="Bold">New Equipment</span>.</p>
      <h2><a name="ref" id="ref"></a>Reference Numbers</h2>
      <p>Use the <a href="../../../general/reference_numbers.htm">Reference Numbers</a> section to create qualified numbers as additional information.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Order release reference numbers are not automatically copied to shipments.</p>
      <h2><a name="totals" id="totals"></a>Totals and Inspections</h2>
      <p>This section displays various calculated totals based on the order release ship unit/line item data such as total weight and volume, secondary weight and volume, ship unit/packaged item counts, and packaging unit count. These values are automatically updated when modifications occur to the order release.</p>
      <p>This read only section displays information related to inspections, licenses, and letter of credit for international shipments. The <span class="Bold">Inspection Required</span>, <span class="Bold">License Required</span>, and <span class="Bold">Letter of Credit Required</span> fields are derived from the information on the <a href="ff_additional_services.htm">Freight Forwarders</a> Additional Services tab. These fields are for informational purposes only and are not used in planning.</p>
      <p>The <span class="Bold">Export License Required</span> field is based on export information from the <a href="ff_line_item.htm#license">order release line item</a>.</p>
