      <p>This page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Shipment Management &gt; Equipment Management &gt; Equipment Group</span>.</p>
      <p>Equipment Groups identify the different kinds of equipment (such as dry vans, flatbed trucks, container cars, hoppers, tankers, box cars, and so on) that are used to transport shipments from one destination to another. An equipment group is defined by an ID and description as well as other attributes that describe the capacity of the equipment (for example, a 28 foot dry van that can handle up to 30,000 pounds).</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: The Equipment Group finder page will not give you access to combination equipment groups. They can only be accessed via the <a href="combination_equipment_group.htm">Combination Equipment Group</a> finder.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If you are creating an equipment group with planes as equipment types, you must create a <a href="create_vehicle_types.htm">vehicle</a> type to associate with this equipment group.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: There must be a 1 to 1 relationship between equipment groups and equipment types when defining them for rail transactions.</p>
      <h2><a id="Creating_an_Equipment_Group"></a>Creating an Equipment Group</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter the <span class="Bold">Equipment Group ID</span>. This is the alpha-numeric string that identifies the equipment group being created (for example, 28FT Dry Van). The <span class="Bold">Equipment Group Name</span> is the alpha-numeric name of the group. This could be the same as the ID.</li>
        <li>Select the domain where this group will be active from the <span class="Bold">Domain Name</span> drop-down list.</li>
        <li>Enter the <span class="Bold">Effective Volume</span>. This is the maximum volume that the equipment group can accommodate. Click the icon to calculate volume by entering length, width, and height.</li>
        <li>Enter the <span class="Bold">Effective Weight</span>. This is the maximum weight that the equipment group can accommodate.</li>
        <li>Mark the <span class="Bold">Container</span> checkbox to identify that this equipment group is a container. Equipment groups with this checkbox marked are considered during the <a href="../order_manager/order_release_other_attributes.htm#Unitization">unitization</a> process that can occur when running the Build Buy Shipment on Primary Leg action for an order release.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Allow LIFO Only</span> checkbox to indicate whether the equipment is for LIFO only. If not selected, may still allow LIFO depending on parameter settings. If selected allows only LIFO.</li>
        <li>Enter the <span class="Bold">Length</span>, <span class="Bold">Width</span>, and <span class="Bold">Height</span> Â of the equipment in the equipment group. These dimensions are used in planning and optimization calculations.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: When you add values to these fields, you also need to choose an appropriate unit of measure from the drop-down list.</p>
        </li>
        <li>In many cases, the height of the door is not equal to the actual height of the equipment, which can lead to loading limitations. Use the <span class="Bold">Door Heigh</span>t field to specify the height of the door so the planning logic can take this under consideration.</li>
        <li>If the equipment has a curved roof, use the <span class="Bold">Curve ID</span> field to define its curved dimensions. The dimensions and shape of the <a href="../power_data/load_configuration/curves.htm">curved</a> roof are defined in power data and assume that the curve in the roof is symmetrical from left to right.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Door Height and Curve definitions for equipment are only considered when using the <a href="../power_data/load_configuration/load_configuration.htm">load configuration</a> functionality. This functionality must be set to run using the PERFORM LOAD CONFIGURATION <a href="../power_data/planning/planning_parameters.htm">parameter</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Equipment Type Code</span> can be used to designate a specific type of equipment and attributes. For information only.</li>
        <li>In the <span class="Bold">Mechanical Designation</span> field, you can enter the alphabetic code assigned to the physical description of the unit. For information only.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Owner Type</span> indicates the type of company that owns the stenciled mark on the equipment. For example private or carrier. For information only.</li>
        <li>You can assign a <span class="Bold">Temperature Control ID</span> to the equipment group to define the minimum/maximum temperature settings that the equipment can provide during transportation. <a href="create_temp_control.htm">Temperature Controls</a> are defined in the Equipment Manager.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If there is no temperature control specified on the equipment, it means no constraint and is considered compatible.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Define the <span class="Bold">TEU Equivalents</span> or the <span class="Bold">FEU Equivalents</span> associated with the equipment. TEU is the Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit and the FEU is the Forty-foot Equivalent Unit. They are used to describe containers for ocean vessel shipments. A forty-foot container would be described as 2 TEU&#39;s or 2 FEU.</li>
        <li>Define the <span class="Bold">Max Left Side Weight</span> and <span class="Bold">Max Right Side Weight</span> to specify the maximum weight allowed on that side of the equipment. In the <span class="Bold">Max Side Difference Weight</span> field, specify the maximum weight difference allowed between the two sides of the equipment to prevent load imbalance.</li>
        <li>Enter the <span class="Bold">Max Length per Ship Unit</span>, <span class="Bold">Max Width</span> <span class="Bold">per Ship Unit</span>, <span class="Bold">Max Height</span> <span class="Bold">per Ship Unit</span> per unit.</li>
        <li>You can enter the <span class="Bold">Max Gross Weight</span>, which is the maximum permissible weight of the equipment and the load. For information only.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Floor Height</span> is the actual height of the platform or floor above the ground or the rail.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Tare Weight</span> field shows the tare weight of the equipment group.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Empty Center of Gravity Length</span> and <span class="Bold">Empty Center of Gravity Width</span> fields show the center of gravity (for the length and width respectively) for the empty equipment group. Both measurements are from the bottom left corner of the equipment.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Empty Center of Gravity Height</span> field indicates the height from Top of Rail to the Center of Gravity when the equipment is empty. For information only.</li>
        <li>Enter the<span class="Bold"> Exterior Length</span>, <span class="Bold">Width</span>, and <span class="Bold">Height</span>.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Has Meter</span> checkbox to indicate if there is a meter on the equipment. The meter is used to measure how much product is discharged at any given stop. If there are 20 stops and orders that range from 10 gal to 300 gal, the driver is not going to dip in a 5 gallon bucket to make deliveries. OTM checks for the presence of a meter on the compartment before allowing the same packaged item to multiple customers (stops).</li>
        <li>Enter a <span class="Bold">Commodity ID,</span> aka shipping family. Only items with the specified commodity will be compatible with this compartment.</li>
        <li>Enter the <span class="Bold"><a href="../power_data/25_general/compartment_type.htm">Compartment Type ID</a></span> to ensure the equipment group is compatible with the compartment type that OTM is considering for use.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Bulk</span> checkbox if this is for a bulk compartment. Bulk items can be mixed (even from different orders) if all of the following are true:
          <ul>
            <li>the Container Optimization Logic Configuration parameter <a href="../power_data/planning/logic_configuration_container_optimization.htm#use_bulk_equipment_group_logic">USE BULK EQUIPMENT GROUP LOGIC</a> is set to true.</li>
            <li>the <a href="../power_data/order_management/bulk_mixing_family.htm">bulk mixing family</a> of a second item to be placed matches the first (both must be defined).</li>
            <li>the <a href="../order_manager/order_release_ship_unit_detail.htm#exclusive_use">Exclusive Use</a> checkbox on the order ship unit is not selected.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><a id="pulling_length"></a>The <span class="Bold">Pulling Length</span> is the pulling length of the container. This is used in <a href="calculation_of_loaded_equipment_dimensions_for_external_distance_engines.htm">calculation of loaded equipment dimensions for external distance engines</a>. It is also part of the <a href="../../configuration/about_sending_equipment_dimensions_to_external_distance_engines.htm">configuration for sending equipment dimensions to external distance engines</a>.
          <ul>
            <li>for semi-trailers, this is the length from the king pin to the rear of the trailer</li>
            <li>for pony trailers, this is the length from the hitch to the rear of the trailer</li>
            <li>for the dromedary, this is the length from the front of the vehicle to the hitch</li>
