    <div role="main">
      <p>This page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Shipment Manager &gt; Shipment Manager &gt; Buy Shipments &gt; Actions &gt; Fleet Management &gt; Assign &gt; Driver</span>.</p>
      <p>Use this action to assign a driver to a shipment. You can manually select a driver, have the system select the best option by clicking OK, or have the system display all valid drivers and then select one.</p>
      <p>When you assign a driver to a shipment, the service provider of the shipment is changed to the one found in the rate offering that is tied to the <a href="../../asset_mgt/driver/driver_manager.htm">driver</a> or <a href="../../asset_mgt/driver/driver_type.htm">driver type</a>. If there is no service provider associated with the driver or driver type, the <a href="../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm#default_service_provider">DEFAULT SERVICE PROVIDER FOR FLEET ASSIGNMENT</a> parameter will be used.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: This action will function for CLOSED-DETACHABLE shipments, but not for STATIC or DYNAMIC shipments.</p>
      <p>When you assign a driver, the associated power unit and the equipment associated with the power unit will be assigned.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: When you run this action, if there are depot stops on the shipment with no pickups or dropoffs, they will be removed from the shipment.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: This action will fail if the shipment has a SECURE_RESOURCES status of TENDERED or ACCEPTED.</p>
      <p>You can configure how to get the driver home by setting the <a href="../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm#MARK_DRIVER_HOME_STOP_FIXED">MARK DRIVER HOME STOP FIXED</a> and <a href="../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm#get_driver_home">GET THE DRIVER HOME FOR FLEET OPTIMIZATION</a> parameters when using this action.</p>
      <p>Filter criteria includes the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The driver&#39;s Next Available Start Time and Next Available End Time which uses driver calendars and calendar events to determine a driver&#39;s availability.</li>
        <li>When filtering by <a href="../power_data/planning/logic_configuration_driver_advanced_filter_topic.htm">Driver Maximum Distance to Shipment</a>, the system looks at both the NAL and the driver&#39;s previous NAL. You have the option of replacing the currently assigned shipment or appending the new shipment to his last one.</li>
        <li>Details about the driver&#39;s hours of service including four elements. You can set a minimum and maximum for each element using the From and To fields. The elements are:
          <ul>
            <li><span class="Bold">Hours to Work</span> indicates how many hours a potential driver candidate has remaining on his 14 hour work rule</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Hours to Drive</span> indicates how many hours a potential driver candidate has remaining on his 11 hour drive rule</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Hours Left on Shift</span>: The action pulls data from a driver&#39;s work profile calendar.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Start of Shift</span>: The action pulls data from a driver&#39;s work profile calendar.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The driver&#39;s rate offering is used. If there is not a driver&#39;s rate offering, the driver types&#39; rate offering is used. If neither driver nor driver type has a rate offering, the shipment is re-rated.</p>
      <p>The assignment of a driver to a shipment can be done the following ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a id="manual_assignment"></a>Manual assignment</span>: To assign a driver manually, select the <span class="Bold">Driver ID</span> option button (default) and enter a Driver ID.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a id="best_option"></a>Best option</span>: After clicking the More Options button, clicking <span class="Bold">OK</span>, automatically selects the best option.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">All options</span>: Use the <a id="show_options"></a><span class="Bold">Show Options</span> button (after clicking the More Options button) to show all valid drivers. A new page opens that displays valid options along with the following fields for review:
          <ul>
            <li><span class="Bold">Costs</span>: Costs associated with the Primary set are the costs used to rank the driver from most desirable to least desirable. Â Secondary and Tertiary are informational. The Driver with he lowest primary set cost is the driver that would be selected as best option. if using that option.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Driver Location</span>: This is the next available location (NAL).</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Driver Time</span>: is displayed in the driver location&#39;s time zone. This is the NAT.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Replace Last Shipment</span>: When you are assigning a driver, you may be given two options for each driver. If the Replace Last Shipment checkbox is selected, then the shipment listed in the Last Shipment ID column will be replaced. If you choose the driver option where the Replace Last Shipment checkbox is not selected, then the shipment is appended to the driver&#39;s schedule.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Last Shipment ID</span>: If you select the driver with this option, then this shipment is replaced by the new shipment.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Assignment Status</span>: If the Replace Last Shipment checkbox is selected, then this field displays the assignment status of the next to last shipment. If the Replace Last Shipment checkbox is not selected, then this field is blank.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Source Location</span>: is the shipment pickup location.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Destination Location</span>: is the shipment drop location.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Empty Distance</span>: This is calculated based on the rate distance of the shipment. This is done after the assignment. This is more accurate than the maximum and minimum distances on the driver advanced filter. The distances on the driver advanced filter are direct distances based on latitude and longitude. This is done before the assignment. These two distance values are normally slightly different.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Driver Home Distance</span>: The distance from the last freighted stop and the driver&#39;s home/end of shift location.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Retained Equipment</span>: This will be selected if
              <br>
              1) if the driver is currently retaining equipment from previous shipment. In this case, the &quot;<span class="Bold">Retained Equipment Type ID</span>&quot; column will be populated with the actual equipment type ID being retained.
              <br>
              2) if the driver&#39;s previous shipment mandates to take empty equipment (i.e.., MOVE EMPTY special service) and the DROP EMPTY AFTER FREIGHT is not processed yet. In this case, the &quot;Retained Equipment Type ID&quot; column will be blank.
              <br>
              It will not be selected in other cases, including when the driver&#39;s previous shipment has CHECK INVENTORY special service.
              <br>
              <br>
              If a driver is currently retaining some multi equipment from its previous shipment, it should be handled as part of equipment type assignment in this shipment - similar to the way it is handled for a single retained equipment. If for example, this equipment cannot be used for freight of the current shipment, the multi equipmentÂ Â should do a Drop Empty Before Freight leg as part of this shipment. </li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Retained Equipment Type ID</span>: refers to the case where driver&#39;s previous assignment requires a live unload and a move empty as dictated by special services.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Next Calendar Event Location Name</span>: The name of the location for the next event in the calendar.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Next Calendar Event Start Time</span>: The start time of the Â next event in the calendar.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Time Left to Work/Time Left to Drive</span>: Derived off the hours of service (HOS) rules for work and drive, and the hours consumed against those rules.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Time Left on Shift</span>: when the Driver time falls before the start of shift, the time left on shift is displayed as end time minus start time and if the driver time is between start of shift and end of shift then, time left on shift is end of shift minus driver current time.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Start of Shift</span>: start of the current day shift. If the current time is beyond the end of today&#39;s shift, it is the start of tomorrow&#39;s shift.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Get the Driver Home</span>: If you leave this drop-down with &quot;Use Parameter Value&quot;, then the <a href="../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm#get_driver_home">Get the Driver Home</a> parameter is used to determine if the driver&#39;s home is added as a stop. Selecting &quot;No&quot; ignores the parameter and does not add the driver&#39;s home as a stop. Selecting &quot;Yes&quot; ignores the parameter, brings the driver home, and displays the Mark Home Stop Fixed field.
              <ul>
                <li><span class="Bold">Mark Home Stop Fixed</span>: If you set the Get the Driver Home value to &quot;Yes&quot;, then the <span class="Bold">Mark Home Stop Fixed</span> field appears. This setting lets you override the settings available in the <a href="../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm#MARK_DRIVER_HOME_STOP_FIXED">MARK DRIVER HOME STOP FIXED parameter</a>, but for this specific situation.Â The possible values are:</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div data-conref="../../assets/snippets/mark home stop fixed.hts">
<p class="TableText">If set to No, the return home stop is not marked as 
 permanent for the driver&#39;s current assignment and also the &quot;Stop_Not_Removable&quot; 
 special service is not set on the home stop. So the next assignment for 
 the driver will start from the last freight stop of the current assignment.</p>
<p class="TableText">If set to Yes, the return home stop is marked as permanent 
 for the driver&#39;s current assignment and also the &quot;Stop_Not_Removable&quot; 
 special service is set on the home stop. So the next assignment for the 
 driver will start from the home location.</p>
<p class="TableText">If set to &quot;Based on Driver Shift&quot;, the &quot;Stop_Not_Removable&quot; 
 special service is set on the home stop, but the permanent flag is not 
 set on the stop. The state of the special service and permanent flag is 
 used as an indicator for the logic to decide whether to remove the home 
 stop based on the driver shifts or not during the next assignment. If 
 the next assignment for the driver falls on the same <a href="../../asset_mgt/driver/driver_manager.htm#shift">shift</a> 
 as the current assignment, then the home stop will be removed. For the 
 next assignment, the driver will start from the last freight stop of the 
 current assignment. Â But, if the next assignment for the driver falls 
 on the next shift or outside the current shift, then the home stop is 
 not removed from the current assignment. The driver will go home after 
 the current assignment and start from the home location for the next assignment.</p>
