  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Split Booking</span></h1>
  <div role="main">
    <p>The Split Booking action provides the ability to split a booking. Oracle Transportation Management has the flexibility to split a booking based on shipment ship unit, equipment, and equipment group and then allocate its costs based on a cost method. The result of splitting a booking is a new shipment where you can enter new booking information. A remark is added to the new shipment and to the shipment that it was split from indicating that it was split, the date when it was split, and the shipment IDs of the new/old shipments.</p>
    <p>The split booking action takes into account two types of split booking scenarios. They are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The service provider informs you that a booking must be split because a physical portion of an order was not loaded onto the primary leg shipment.</li>
      <li>The freight forwarder is unable to load freight onto the consol.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: In many cases, the shipment to be split is a shipment which has already been booked and accepted by the service provider. The shipment resulting from the split does not need to be booked with the service provider and should automatically be considered to be in a &#39;Tender Accepted&#39; state.</p>
    <p>The new shipment primarily exists to support the creation of documentation. The shipment&#39;s destination country controls what type of bill of lading process should be followed for the split booking. Either the existing Bill of Lading document is sufficient or a new bill of lading needs to be issued for the split booking.</p>
    <h2><a name="buy" id="buy"></a>Split To Buy Shipment</h2>
    <h3>Splitting from a Buy Shipment</h3>
    <p>The <span class="Bold">Split- To Buy Shipment</span> is the buy shipment which the split off load is put onto.</p>
    <p>Choose between creating a <span class="Bold">New</span> Buy Shipment that will remain within its original consol or attach the excess to an <span class="Bold">Existing</span> Buy Shipment within an existing consol. Select New when the service provider is at fault. Select Existing when the freight forwarder is at fault.</p>
    <p>If attaching the excess to an existing buy shipment and consol, enter the buy shipment you want to attach the excess to.</p>
    <p>When a new buy shipment is used, a Split- To Buy Shipment and Split- To sell Shipment is created and costs are prorated based on the selected cost split method. Any additional costs are incurred by the service provider.</p>
    <p>When an existing buy shipment is used, the buy shipment is re-rated and Sell Shipment is prorated based on the split cost method. The existing job for the Split- To Buy Shipment is updated to include the Split- To sell Shipment information. Any additional cost are incurred by the freight forwarder. The freight forwarder&#39;s client is not responsible for these costs.</p>
    <h3>Splitting from a Sell Shipment</h3>
    <p>Based on the sell side shipment selected, choose the buy shipment that is impacted. The listed Split- From Buy Shipments are the buy shipments with the same order release as the Split- From Sell Shipment selected.</p>
    <h2><a name="sell" id="sell"></a>Split From Sell Shipment</h2>
    <h3>Splitting from a Buy Shipment</h3>
    <p>The <span class="Bold">Split- From Sell Shipment</span> is the sell shipment that is impacted due to the splitting of the buy shipment. The Split- From Sell Shipments are the sell shipments with the same order release as the Split- From Buy Shipment.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: In order to split from a Buy Shipment, an associated Sell Shipment must be available.</p>
    <h3>Splitting from a Sell Shipment</h3>
    <p>This section is not available since you have selected the sell shipment to work from already.</p>
    <h2><a name="types" id="types"></a>Split Types</h2>
    <p>Choose how the shipment is to be <a href="split_shipment_groups.htm">split</a>. Much like the Split Shipment Action, split a shipment based on the following criteria:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="split_booking_types.htm#splitSU">Shipment Ship Unit</a></li>
      <li><a href="split_booking_types.htm#equipment">Equipment</a></li>
      <li><a href="split_booking_types.htm#splitEG">Equipment Group</a>
        <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: When splitting either a buy or sell side shipment, all the ship units, equipment, and equipment groups expressed are from the sell side shipment. However, both the buy and sell shipment are split.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="cost" id="cost"></a>Split Costs</h2>
    Designate how to split the cost between the original shipment and the split shipment. Choices for splitting the costs are:
    <ul>
      <li><span class="Bold">Zero Rate</span><span class="Bold">:</span> The total cost is fixed on the original shipment while the new spilt shipment cost is zero. For this cost type, an original shipment of 500 dollars remains 500 dollars and the split shipment has no cost associated with it.</li>
      <li><span class="Bold">Prorate by Weight</span><span class="Bold">:</span> The cost between the original shipment and the new split shipment is divided evenly based on weight. For example, if 100 pounds out of a 500 pound shipment costing 1,000 dollars is put onto a new split shipment, the original shipment cost would be adjusted to 800 dollars and the split shipment cost would be 200 dollars.</li>
      <li><span class="Bold">Divide Evenly</span><span class="Bold">:</span> The cost is split evenly between the original shipment and the new split shipment.</li>
      <li><span class="Bold">Prorate by Equipment Counts</span><span class="Bold">:</span> The cost is split between the total number of containers between the original and split shipment. For instance, if you had 9 containers for the original shipment and 1 container for the new split shipment, 90% of the cost would go to the original shipment and 10% of the cost would go to the new split shipment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Based on who is at fault for splitting the shipment, the cost has different implications. If the service provider is at fault, the freight forwarder and its client see no cost increase from the original shipment. If the freight forwarder is at fault, any increases in cost are incurred by the freight forwarder. This freight forwarder&#39;s increased cost are not passed to its client.</p>
    <p>Click <span class="Bold">Ok</span> to enter split details based off the <a href="split_booking_types.htm">split type</a> selected.</p>
