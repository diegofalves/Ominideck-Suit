    <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Shipment Ship Unit Detail</span></h1>
    <div role="main">
      <p>This page is accessed from the Stops tab on the Shipment Manager page. This page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Shipment Management &gt; Shipment Management &gt; Buy Shipments</span> or <span class="Bold">Sell Shipments</span>. Click the <span class="Bold">Stop</span> tab. Then click <span class="Bold">New Stop,</span> or <span class="Bold">Edit</span> to edit an existing stop. From the <span class="Bold">Shipment Stops</span> page, click the <span class="Bold">New Ship Unit</span> button.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If this shipment was planned from an order release, the ship unit data from the order release appears on this page.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter the number of ship units by entering a value in the <span class="Bold">Ship Unit Count</span> field. The ship unit count acts as a multiplier for the weight or volume of the units. For example, if the ship unit weight is 10 pounds and the ship unit count is 3, then the total weight of the ship units is 30 pounds.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Transport Handling Unit</span> defines the type of packaging for the ship unit. For example, you can choose one of the public transport handling units such as a pallet, box, tote, and so on. The details of these are defined in Power Data and include attributes such as length, width, height, gross weight, tare weight, and effective volume which defines capacity. Since the defaults are considered public data, you cannot modify the attributes. However, you can define your own in <a href="../../power_data/25_general/ship_unit_spec.htm">power data</a>.</li>
        <li>Use the <span class="Bold">Activity</span> field to indicate whether the ship units are being picked up (P) or delivered (D) at the current stop. Alternatively, use other (O) to indicate the ship units will not be picked up or delivered at the current stop. O is ignored by planning and rating. Use the <span class="Bold">Activity Time</span> to indicate the amount of time the activity is expected to take.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Total Gross Weight/Volume per Ship Unit</span> displays weight/volume that would include all product and packaging weight per ship unit. Gross weight/volume is typically used for transportation planning. It may be used for rating in most cases.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Total Net Weight/Volume per Ship Unit</span> displays the weight/volume of a product without any handling units or packaging. For some shippers this includes the weight/volume of the carton. However, the net weight/volume may define the quantity of usable product. In all cases, it does not include the weight/volume of the ship unit such as a pallet.</li>
        <li>Select a <span class="Bold"><a href="../../../field_definitions/flexible_commodity_qualifier.htm">flexible commodity qualifier</a></span> to describe the content of your order in terms of a specific classification.</li>
        <li>Enter a <span class="Bold"><a href="../../material_manager/create_commodity.htm">commodity code</a></span>. The value that you enter in the Commodity Code field depends on the flexible commodity qualifier that you select.</li>
        <li>Enter the <span class="Bold">Length per Ship Unit</span>, <span class="Bold">Weight per Ship Unit</span>, <span class="Bold">Height per Ship Unit</span>, and <span class="Bold">Volume per Ship Unit</span> for the material and choose a unit of measure for each. Note that the Ship Unit Count field acts as a multiplier for the Weight and Volume fields. The value you enter for weight applies for a single ship unit. For example, if the ship unit weight is 10 pounds and the ship unit count is 3, then the total weight is 30 pounds.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Priority</span> displays the priority used in equipment packing (derived from the Ship Unit &gt; Ship Unit Spec &gt; Packaged Item &gt; Item hierarchy). This helps in understanding what priority is used when analyzing the shipments.</li>
        <li>If the ship unit is cylindrical, you can specify its overall <span class="Bold">Diameter</span> and <span class="Bold">Core Diameter</span>. These values are used in <a href="../../power_data/load_configuration/load_configuration.htm">load configuration</a> evaluations.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If you specified the diameter values on an order, they are copied to the shipment that is planned from the <a href="../../order_manager/create_new_ship_unit.htm">order</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Use the <span class="Bold">Shipment Equipment</span> field to connect the ship unit to shipment equipment. This associates the ship unit being shipped with the equipment carrying them. You can only select equipment entered on the Equipment Detail page.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Bulk Splittable</span> checkbox determines whether a ship unit with a quantity of 0 or 1 can be split into multiple ship units and placed on multiple shipments or multiple equipment.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Count Splittable</span> checkbox applies when the ship unit count is 2 or more. If it is selected, you can split one or more (but not all) ship unit pieces of this ship unit. If not selected, you cannot split by piece.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: For Visibility and Supply Chain Event Management (SCEM) purposes, it is important to track the amount ordered versus the amount booked versus the amount shipped versus the amount received. In order to manage all of these amounts, Oracle Transportation Management has the notion of the amount received of the product.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Received</span> fields can be used to record the appropriate received values for the ship unit in terms of gross/net weight and volume, as well as count. You can enter these values here or you can set up an <a href="../../../agent_manager/agent_actions_by_object/buy_shipment_agent_actions.htm">agent</a> that can copy these values from <a href="../../../execution/25_shipment_status/add_shipment_tracking_event.htm">shipment tracking events</a> that are recorded for the shipment. These are stored at the ship unit level. The received amounts are not used in the calculation of the rating engine. They are used for visibility and alerting. This provides the ability to look at the amount that was shipped versus the amount that was received. Generally, the received amount is entered by one of the trading partners and not the logistics planner.
          <br>
          <br>
          These values are not used in shipment planning or rating and only used for information. </li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Order Release Ship Unit ID</span> displays the ship unit ID from the order release that was used to create this shipment ship unit for reference. This field is not-editable if the shipment was created via shipment -new (not planned from an order release), so basically you cannot associate a manual shipment (shipment as work) with an order. To create a normal shipment from an order but bypass some business logic, you can use the Create Shipment - Manual action.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Permanent</span> checkbox can be used to identify the stops that you do not want deleted when shipment updates are sent into Oracle Transportation Management via integration. If you mark a stop as permanent and a shipment update occurs via the Planned Shipment interface (INS) with a Transaction Code of RC (Replace Children), any stop marked as permanent will be left as is. If you use the IU Transaction Code on the INS interface, all stops are updated regardless of the Permanent setting.
          <br>
          <br>
          You can use the Permanent checkbox to ensure that a ship unit is not removed as a result of Actual Shipment interface. Oracle Transportation Management supports replacing the ship units within a shipment using the ActualShipment XML Interface. The ship units are actually separate objects from shipments and are only referenced in a shipment via the Shipment Stop Detail records. A ship unit can exist across multiple shipments. To replace the ship units on a shipment, use the TransactionCode of RC with a ReplaceChildren.ManagedChild of ShipmentStopDetail. This removes all the Shipment Stop Detail records for the shipment stops. The Shipment Stop Detail records that have a value of IsPermanent = Y in the database are not removed. </li>
        <li>When a Ship Unit is no longer referenced in a shipment, the assignment of the ship unit to the shipment equipment on the shipment is removed, provided that the shipment equipment is not used on another shipment. The initial value of the ShipmentStopDetail.IsPermanent when the shipment is created through planning is defined by the CREATE PERMANENT SHIP UNITS <a href="../../power_data/planning/planning_parameters.htm">parameter</a>.</li>
        <li>Enter <span class="Bold"><a href="../../../field_definitions/tags.htm">Tags</a></span>.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="seal" id="seal"></a>Ship Unit Seal</h2>
      <p>Use this section to identify any seals on the ship unit. You can add as many seals as you want for a ship unit for information.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter the <span class="Bold"><a href="../../../field_definitions/seal_number.htm">ship unit seal</a></span>.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="Bold">Save</span> for each ship unit seal.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="ref" id="ref"></a>Ship Unit Reference Number</h2>
      <p>Use this section to record reference numbers for the ship unit.</p>
      <h2><a name="remarks" id="remarks"></a>Ship Unit Remark</h2>
      <p>Enter any remarks that you want to associate with the ship unit.</p>
      <h2><a name="ip" id="ip"></a>Ship Unit Involved Party</h2>
      <p>Use this section to record involved parties for the ship unit.</p>
      <h2><a name="line" id="line"></a>Ship Unit Line</h2>
      <p>You can use this section to describe the ship unit lines included in the ship unit.</p>
