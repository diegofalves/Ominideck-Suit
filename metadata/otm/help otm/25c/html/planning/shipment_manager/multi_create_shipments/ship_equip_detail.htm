    <p>This page is accessed via:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="Bold">Shipment Management &gt; Shipment Management &gt; Shipment Equipment</span>.</li>
      <li><span class="Bold">Shipment Management &gt; Shipment Management &gt; Buy Shipments</span> or <span class="Bold">Sell Shipments</span>. On the <span class="Bold">Equipment</span> tab,Â in the <span class="Bold">Shipment Equipment</span> section, click the <span class="Bold">New</span> icon for the <span class="Bold">Shipment Equipment</span> field.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Values on the Shipment Equipment page define the details of equipment used on shipments.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If you do not need equipment details on your shipment, click <span class="Bold">Save</span> without making any entry on this page.</p>
    <h2><a name="Equipment" id="Equipment"></a>Actual Equipment</h2>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: In this section, only the Equipment Type and Equipment Group fields affect planning. The other fields are for information only and may appear as the result of information entered in <a href="../shipment_actuals/edit_shipment_actuals.htm">shipment actuals</a>.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>During shipment planning, a <span class="Bold">Shipment Equipment ID</span> is automatically assigned to the shipment and linked to the assigned Equipment Group. If you are adding a new Shipment Equipment, enter a Shipment Equipment ID to identify the equipment.</li>
      <li>An <a href="../../equip_manager/create_equip_type.htm"><span class="Bold">Equipment Type</span></a> is a category of equipment. Oracle Transportation Management uses equipment types when it determines equipment capacity. If you enter an Equipment Type and capacity checking is turned on, Oracle Transportation Management checks to determine whether the Equipment Type you select is available at the shipment start time.</li>
      <li>An <a href="../../equip_manager/create_equip_group.htm"><span class="Bold">Equipment Group</span></a> identifies the kind of equipment such as dry vans, flatbed trucks, container cars, hoppers, tankers, box cars, and so on. If the rate offering applied to the shipment includes Equipment Groups, Oracle Transportation Management uses the Equipment Group to determine the shipment cost. In addition, Equipment Groups can be associated with Vehicle Types that determine what ship units can fit on the equipment.</li>
      <li>The <span class="Bold">Equipment Type Code</span> field can be used to designate a specific type of equipment and attributes. For information only.</li>
      <li>In the <span class="Bold">Mechanical Designation</span> field, you can enter the alphabetic code assigned to the physical description of the unit. For information only.</li>
      <li>Use the <span class="Bold"><a href="../../equip_manager/create_equipment.htm">Equipment ID</a></span> field to enter the identifier for a particular piece of equipment.</li>
      <li>For Equipment Number, Equipment Initial, and Equipment Initial Number fields:
        <ol>
          <li>You can enter values in the Â <span class="Bold">Equipment Initial</span> and <span class="Bold">Equipment Number</span> fields that identify a particular piece of equipment. If both these fields are blank and the Equipment Initial/Number field is populated, then these fields with be filled with data from the Initial/Number field.</li>
          <li>The <span class="Bold">Equipment Initial/Number</span> field is a concatenation of equipment initial and equipment number. The initial is a mark that is registered with national or international authorities that is associated with a specific owner.
            <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If all three fields are populated via XML at the same time, the fields will hold the data as entered.<br>
              If the concatenated Initial and Number field is populated, only the Equipment Initial or Equipment Number field is populated with a letter/number combination, the letters will be split from the numbers.Â The numbers will be entered in the Equipment Number field and the letters will be entered in the Equipment Initial field.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The <span class="Bold">Check Digit</span> field is used to validate that the Equipment Initial/Number field is entered correctly. You can leave this field blank if you do not want to validate Equipment Initial/Number. The ISO 6346 for ocean containers is used to verify the check digit value.</li>
      <li>Optionally, enter a value in the <span class="Bold">License Plate</span> field.</li>
      <li>You can use the <span class="Bold">Substitute Equipment Group ID</span> field to document the substitute equipment that is provided. Sometimes a service provider may not have the actual equipment that was originally planned for and may need to provide substitute equipment for the shipment.</li>
      <li><span class="Bold">Type Assignment Code</span> indicates if the Equipment is fixed from order (equipment type was specified on order) or Resource capacity, meaning it came from the resource assignment during the build shipment process.</li>
      <li><span class="Bold">Assignment Code</span> indicates if the Equipment Type is fixed from order, meaning that it was specified on the order, or came from resource assignment.</li>
      <li>Enter the <span class="Bold">Intermodal Equipment Length</span>.</li>
      <li>Enter the <span class="Bold">Scale Weight</span> to define the measure used to weigh equipment at the scale location.</li>
      <li><span class="Bold">Scale Location</span> identifies a location where equipment is weighed. This is not an Oracle Transportation Management location and appears for information only.</li>
      <li>Use the <span class="Bold">Scale Name</span> field to enter the name for the scale used to weigh the equipment.</li>
      <li>Use the <span class="Bold">Scale Ticket</span> field to enter an ID for the scale.</li>
      <li>Use the <span class="Bold">Weight Qualifier</span> field to select the type of weight measurement.</li>
      <li>Enter a value in the <span class="Bold">Tare Weight</span> field to define the weight of a container and/or packing materials without the weight of the goods it contains.</li>
      <li>Enter the <span class="Bold">Load Configuration Volume</span>. This is the actual volume taken by loading the units. Normally, it is larger than the total volume computed using the unit volume of the unit.</li>
      <li>Select a <span class="Bold">Domain</span>.</li>
      <li>The Â <span class="Bold">Freight Center of Gravity</span> fields show the calculated <a href="../../equip_manager/center_of_gravity.htm">center of gravity</a> values for the freight length, width and height.</li>
      <li>The gross Center of Gravity is only applicable to equipment that is balanced on the axles (i.e. when a cargo load is supported entirely by the wheels of an equipment), and not applicable to tractor trailers or multi-unit equipment. (i.e. when the load is distributed over an articulated equipment), that one can calculate the C of G correctly. The user must input to empty C of G for the unloaded vehicle. The gross C of G is the combination of the cargo and the equipment.Â  Gross values are populated only if the empty C of G Values exists on the equipment group else the gross values calculation will be skipped. If tareweight is not defined on equipment group, it would be considered as 0, and the gross values are calculated. In this case, fright and gross C of G Values will become equal.</li>
      <li>You can enter the following details. These are information only:
        <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down">
          <ul>
