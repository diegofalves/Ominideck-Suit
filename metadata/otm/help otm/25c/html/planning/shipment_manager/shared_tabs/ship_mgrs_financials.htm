    <div role="main">
      <p>This page is accessed viaÂ <span class="Bold">Shipment Management &gt; Shipment Management &gt; Buy Shipments</span> or <span class="Bold">Sell Shipments</span>. Click the <span class="Bold">Financials</span> tab.</p>
      <p>The Financials tab lists financial information associated with the shipment.</p>
      <p>The property <a href="../../../properties/glog/business.property.htm#shipment.costFractionalDigits">glog.business.shipment.costFractionalDigits</a> sets the decimal place precision when calculating shipment costs. You can enter zero or any positive integer Â to define the precision.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Cost Fixed</span> checkbox to indicate that the cost for this entire shipment is fixed. Marking the cost as fixed prevents the recalculation of costs.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Rate Record Fixed</span> checkbox to indicate that the rate record for this shipment is fixed and cannot be changed.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Rate Offering Fixed</span> checkbox to indicate that the rate offering for this shipment is fixed. Marking the rate offering as fixed prevents Oracle Transportation Management from suggesting other rate offerings during recalculation.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Total Actual Cost</span> field displays the current cost of the shipment as calculated by the sum of all cost types listed. Initially, after a shipment is planned, the Total Actual Cost is the same as the Planned Cost. However, if you make any changes to the shipment after initial planning such as changing the service provider, re-rating the shipment after rate modifications, or adding a cost manually, the Total Actual Cost is updated accordingly. The Planned Cost is not updated and always reflects the cost from the initial planning.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Auto Approve Rules in Financials compare the total actual cost with the net amount due on the invoice.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Planned Cost</span> field displays the cost that was calculated during shipment planning based on the appropriate rate. This cost always remains the same regardless of any shipment modifications that may affect the cost. Refer to the Total Actual Cost field to see the impacts of cost changes after planning.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Total Weighted Cost</span> field reflects the application of a Rate Quality Factor against the Total Actual Cost. For example, if the rate offering that is used to rate the shipment includes a Quality Factor, a Total Weight Cost value is calculated based on the attributes of the Rate Quality Factor and the Total Actual Cost. It can be used to increase or decrease the shipment cost and can represent a rate modifier assigned to service providers based on performance.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Current Market Cost</span> field displays the market cost. This value is updated:
          <ul>
            <li>when you run the shipment action &#39;Fetch and Update Market Cost&#39;</li>
            <li>when you award a spot bid tender to a carrier and the market cost is available on the spot bid response page</li>
            <li>when you run the agent actionÂ &#39;Fetch and Update Market Cost&#39;.
              <br>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Total Trans Cost</span> represents the total transportation cost after applying rebates. It reflects the Total Actual Cost minus the rebate amount as defined in the Secondary Charge Rules. Once the transportation shipment and/or related secondary charge shipments have an invoice that as been paid, it will change to be the total of the amount paid for that shipment.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Original Invoice Cost</span> field displays the initial invoice amount received from the carrier. This field only appears on buy shipments.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Total Matched Invoice Cost</span> field contains the initial invoice amount adjusted by any additional charges or invoices that the carrier later sent to you. This field only appears on buy shipments.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Total Approved Cost</span> field shows what you have agreed to pay to the carriers based on approved vouchers. This field only appears on buy shipments.</li>
        <li>A <a href="../../rate_manager/create_rate_offering.htm">rate offering</a> is a contract with a service provider that determines the cost for transportation.</li>
        <li>A <a href="../../rate_manager/create_rate_record.htm">rate record</a> provides specific costing or rating data from one location to another.
          <br>
          <br>
          For planned shipments, Oracle Transportation Management performs calculations to determine the lowest cost rate offering available for the shipment based on service provider, source and destination locations, itinerary, transportation mode, equipment, and the items being transported.
          <br>
          <br>
          If you assign a rate offering and a rate record manually, Oracle Transportation Management uses the rate you enter to calculate the shipment cost for the bill and/or invoice. The rate offering you select must be one that is valid for the shipment&#39;s transportation mode and service provider.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: For shipments created in the Order Manager or Process Manager, different rates appear for buy and sell shipments. Manual shipments use Buy rates.</p>
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: You can set the <a href="../../../agent_manager/public_agents.htm">public agent</a> to assign rates for manual shipments.</p>
          The <span class="Bold">Spot Costed</span> checkbox is automatically selected as a result of a successful <a href="../../location_manager/open_tender.htm">open tender</a> process. </li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Advanced Charge</span> checkbox can be selected or cleared by running the <a href="../flag_unflag_advanced_charge.htm">Flag As Advanced Charge</a> and Unflag as Advanced Charge actions from a sell shipment and sell NFRC (non-freight related charge). An advanced charge is a charge on a job that is collected on the forwarder&#39;s behalf. This field only appears on sell shipments.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a name="Planned" id="Planned"></a>Planned Rate Offering</span> and <span class="Bold">Planned Rate Record</span> are display-only fields that display the original rate offering and record what was selected when this shipment was originally planned from an order. The values in these fields remain unchanged as any changes are made to the shipment that may change the rate. This provides a record of the original rate that was used when the shipment was first planned. These files are not populated if you are creating a manual shipment (Shipment as Work).</li>
        <li>The <a href="../../../execution/shipment_groups/secondary_charge_rule.htm">Secondary Charge Rule</a> field indicates what secondary charge rule was copied from the order and used to assign <a href="../../../execution/shipment_groups/secondary_charge.htm">secondary charges</a>.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Payment Method Codes</span> identify the manner in which payment is made on a shipment and can be used as an alternative to Incoterms. The Payment Method Code from the order base is copied to each shipment that is created from the order base unless you have specified Payment Method Codes on the legs of the itinerary that was used to create this shipment. In this case, the Payment Method Code on the <a href="../../itinerary_manager/create_leg_detail.htm">leg</a> of the itinerary is copied to the shipment (overriding the code specified on the order). Payment Method Codes can also be assigned to each shipment cost record as described below.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: The copying of payment method codes from an order or itinerary is controlled by the <a href="../../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm">parameter</a> SET PAYMENT TERMS ON BUILT SHIPMENTS. The default is true.</p>
        </li>
        <li><span class="Bold"><a name="INCO" id="INCO"></a><a href="../../power_data/order_management/inco_terms.htm">Incoterms</a></span> are industry standard terms which define how payments are made.</li>
        <li>Use the <span class="Bold">Incoterm Location</span> field to enter information concerning contract terms for the shipment by providing additional information about the shipment.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Parcel Zone</span> field is populated if a rating zone is returned from BluJay Solutions during rating. The field is only populated via the BluJay Solutions integration. It is not populated when rating parcel shipments using local rates.</li>
      </ol>
      <div data-conref="../../../assets/snippets/Kewill.hts">
<p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note:</span> BluJay Solutions Parcel 
 (formerly Kewill Flagship Parcel Rates) is <span class="Bold">not supported</span>.</p>

</div>
      <h2><a name="tariff" id="tariff"></a>Tariff Information</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Organization Number</span> and the <span class="Bold">Organization Name</span> define the organization that is responsible for administering the tariff.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Tariff Number</span> and <span class="Bold">Tariff Name</span> fields identify a particular tariff. Enter or edit tariff information associated with the shipment. Tariff information is not included in any calculations performed by Oracle Transportation Management.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Tariff Date</span> displays the date when the tariff is no longer valid.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="insurance" id="insurance"></a>Insurance Information</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter an <span class="Bold">Insurance Policy Number</span>.</li>
        <li>Enter an <span class="Bold">Insurance Amount</span>.</li>
        <li>Enter an <span class="Bold">Insurance Premium</span>.</li>
        <li>Indicate whether or not duty has been paid by using the <span class="Bold">Duty Paid</span> drop-down box. The value of the <span class="Bold">Duty Paid</span> field is copied from the order to the shipment during the build shipments process. If any order on the shipment has a Duty Paid of YES, then the shipment is marked as YES.
          <br>
          <br>
          When the <a href="../../../settlement/25_payment_manager/26_payment_actions/calculate_vat.htm">Calculate VAT</a> action is run for an invoice or a bill, the VAT logic looks at this field. If the value is YES, then Oracle Transportation Management uses the VAT Outcome of EXEMPT. If the value is NO or NA, then VAT logic runs regularly. </li>
        <li>Indicate the insurer&#39;s contact information in the <span class="Bold">Insured By</span> field.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Bill of Lading Type</span> from the drop-down list.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Bill of Lading Issuance Type</span> from the drop-down list.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="Cost1" id="Cost1"></a>Costs</h2>
      <p>This section of the page provides a detailed breakdown of each shipment cost by cost type based on initial shipment planning or manual cost entries.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Define new costs by clicking the <span class="Bold"><a href="new_cost_type.htm">New Shipment Cost</a></span> button.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Shipment Cost Calculation Details</h3>
      <p>A <span class="Bold">Shipment Cost</span> column appears as a hyperlink for any shipment that was planned when the <a href="../../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm#rating_engine_stores_detailed_cost">Rating Engine Stores Detailed Cost Information</a> <a href="../../power_data/planning/planning_parameters.htm">parameter</a> is turned on.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: No details are provided for any shipment that was planned prior to the activation of this parameter. However, if you run any action that causes Oracle Transportation Management to re-rate a shipment (such as Assign Rate or Change Service Provider) after the parameter was activated, the Details appear.</p>
      <p>If you click the View icon, a pop-up opens showing the Actual Amount, <a href="../../../general/functional_currency.htm">Functional Amount</a> and Exchange Rate information. This column presents a breakdown of the calculations for each individual cost. It appears as a text description of how a cost type was calculated based on the configuration of the rate that was used to plan the shipment. Click the Cost Type description to display the source records that control the calculations. For example, click Base Cost to display that rate record that was used to calculate the base cost or click Accessorial to display the Accessorial Cost page. Note that Circuity, Stopoff, and Other Cost Types provide no link to source records.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: The currency displayed for the shipment cost depends on your current user preferences. However, the currencies displayed in the Details column is the same as what was defined on the rate record (Rate Costs tab).</p>
      <p>The Ship Unit and Ship Unit Line columns hold information about individual units and lines that are associated with the shipment. If your shipment consists of parcels that are rated by an external service engine, the Shipment Cost column will show the costs for each individual parcel, provided that you have provided the correct data to the external rating engine.</p>
      <p>If the cost type is Accessorial, the Accessorial Code and Accessorial Code Description fields are populated with the code and description respectively.</p>
      <p>Carton level costs are captured as part of shipment cost using Ship Unit/Ship Unit Line/ Tracking Number fields in this section. Details like tracking number, invoice cost, weight are captured as part of the existing invoice and invoice line item details. Based on the match rule definition (i.e. using tracking number) you can match parcel invoices with shipment/ship unit/ship unit line. Once matching is complete, it can then be approved based on the specific parcel costs/weights of corresponding matched shipment, ship unit or ship unit line.</p>
      <h2><a name="information" id="information"></a>Informational Costs</h2>
      <p>Use this section to define <a href="information_cost_type.htm">information cost types</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Click the <a href="information_cost_type.htm">New Information Shipment Cost</a> button to define new costs.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a name="access" id="access"></a>Accessorials</h2>
      <p>Use this section to assign one or more <span class="Bold"><a href="new_shipment_accessorial_ss.htm">Accessorial codes</a></span> that you want applied to the shipment.</p>
      <p>The codes that you specify must also be identified in the rate that was used for the shipment. If a matching code is found on the rate, the appropriate cost is applied to the shipment and is listed as a cost type in the Shipment Cost Details section of the page. You can edit the additional charges from that section of the page.</p>
      <h2><a name="Special" id="Special"></a>Special Services</h2>
      <p>Use this section to assign any Special Service codes that will apply to this shipment or to edit any special service codes already assigned to the shipment.</p>
      <p>There will be only one shipment special service for each stop per activity.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: In order to apply secondary charges for &quot;shipment special service&quot; or &quot;shipment stop special service&quot;, you have to use the &quot;<a href="../add_third_party_service_provider.htm">Add third party service provider</a>&quot; action on the shipment.</p>
      <h2><a name="Equipment" id="Equipment"></a>Equipment Type Inventory Processing</h2>
      <p>There are three checkboxes that indicate if inventory processing has occurred. The following potential places are where inventory needs to be processed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="Bold">Drop Empty Before Freight Processed</span>: at the freight delivery stop of the driver&#39;s previous shipment</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Pick Empty Before Freight Processed</span>: at the freight pickup stop at the current shipment</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Drop Empty After Freight Processed</span>: at the freight delivery stop on the current shipment</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="LinkList">These checkboxes are not selected when the shipment is created. They are selected when the inventory is checked and a decision is made for the shipment. The planning logic uses these values and the existence and non-existence of the shipment equipment to determine what decisions still need to be made on the shipment. These checkboxes can be manually selected.</p>
