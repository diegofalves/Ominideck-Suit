    <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Shipment Cost Detail</span></h1>
    <div role="main">
      <p>Access the Shipment Manager page via:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="Bold">Shipment Management &gt; Shipment Manager</span> <span class="Bold">&gt; Buy Shipments</span> (or <span class="Bold">Sell Shipments</span>) and click the <span class="Bold">Financials</span> tab. Scroll to the <span class="Bold">Costs</span> section of the page and click <span class="Bold">New Shipment Cost</span>.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Shipment Management &gt; Shipment Management &gt; Shipment Cost</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Use the Shipment Cost page to add a new shipment cost or edit an existing cost and to optionally assign the cost to the appropriate order which allows allocation to more accurately assign costs.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select a valid <span class="Bold">Cost Type</span>. The options are:
          <ul>
            <li><span class="Bold"><a id="Base"></a>Base</span>: The base cost associated with the shipment as determined by the standard basis options defined on the rate. If you are entering a base cost manually, enter a value in the <span class="Bold">Shipment Cost</span> field and select the currency you want. The Base Cost Type does not include charges for Accessorials, Discounts, or Stop-offs as defined on the rate or entered manually.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Accessorial</span>: This cost appears for any charge that is a result of an Accessorial being applied to the shipment as a result of shipment planning or manual entry. It can be a calculated surcharge that applies to the shipment based on Accessorial Codes that are assigned to the rate that was used for the shipment. It can also represent a fixed charge that is not calculated based on any Accessorial Code assignment on a rate.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Stop-Off Charge</span>: This cost represents the calculated stop-off charges based on the total number of shipment stops and the Per Stop Charge defined on the <a href="../../rate_manager/rate_offering_attributes.htm#Stop_offCharge">rate offering</a> that was used to rate this shipment.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Discount</span>: This cost is the calculated discount amount based on the <a href="../../rate_manager/rate_costs_details.htm">rate cost discount</a> defined on the rate record that was used to rate this shipment or entered manually.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Circuity</span>: This cost defines how the circuity of a multi-stop route affects the rate. Sometimes a service provider may offer a rate that charges based on the first and last stops in a route, while not charging for any stops in between. To be cost-effective, service providers often require that the mid-points of the route be within a reasonable distance of the end points.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Delta</span>: This cost is the difference between the cost on the shipment and the cost on the invoice. For example, the shipment may have a cost of $1000. but the invoice came in at $1200. The delta will be $200. A line is added to the shipment so you can see the original cost and the delta on the shipment.</li>
            <li><span class="Bold">Other</span>: A cost other than those Cost Types mentioned above that was entered manually.
              <br>
              The Total Weighted Cost is showing as cost type &#39;Other&#39; if the rate has a <a href="../../power_data/rates_and_codes/rate_quality_factors.htm">rate quality ID factor</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If you record a description for a Rate Cost (on the Rate Record), it will appear in place of the default Cost Type Base listed above.
            <br>
            <br>
            Also, if you record a description for an <a href="../../power_data/rates_and_codes/accessorial_codes.htm">accessorial</a>, <a href="../../power_data/rates_and_codes/special_service_codes.htm">special service code</a>, or <a href="../../power_data/rates_and_codes/accessorial_costs.htm">accessorial cost</a> in Power Data, it will appear in place the of the default Cost Type Accessorial listed above. </p>
        </li>
        <li>Enter the appropriate <span class="Bold">Shipment Cost</span> and <span class="Bold">Currency</span>.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Cost Category ID</span> is a read-only field. This data is copied to the shipment cost during the rating process.</li>
        <li>If applicable, enter a <span class="Bold">tracking number</span>. Generally, tracking numbers are unique identifiers assigned to a shipment by a parcel carrier.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Cost Fixed</span> checkbox if you want this cost type to always remain on the shipment regardless of whether the shipment is re-rated. Use this checkbox for manually-applied cost types such as Accessorial or Other. If a shipment is re-rated for any reason, these costs will stay on the shipment as entered. If you mark this checkbox for any other cost types, those cost types and related values will also remain on the shipment; however, new cost types may appear as a result of shipment re-rating which may not make sense. For example, you probably do not want to mark a Base Cost Type as fixed.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: This checkbox is automatically marked as a result of a successful <a href="../../location_manager/open_tender.htm">Open Tender</a> process.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Marking the <span class="Bold">Process As Flow Through</span> checkbox will force the corresponding shipment accessorial cost, regardless of the flow through field on the <a href="../../power_data/rates_and_codes/accessorial_codes.htm">Accessorial Code</a> to be copied from the buy-side to the sell-side during the sell shipment rating process. Only buy shipment Accessorial costs will be copied to the sell shipment.
          <p>When the Buy Shipment has shipment cost with Accessorial Code having <span class="Bold">Flow Thru</span> as checked then these costs are also copied to sell shipment.</p>
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: The Process As Flow Through checkbox is only applicable to Buy Shipments. Buy Shipments Secondary Charge Shipment related costs are not moved to the Sell Shipment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Enter an identifier in the <span class="Bold">Cost Identifier</span> field. This can be used to differentiate between costs with the same cost types. For example, if there are two shipment costs with cost type as base, then they can be differentiated by adding a description in the Cost Identifier field. This field will be used to define bill to party for each cost for generation of an invoice.</li>
        <li>In addition to assigning a manual accessorial charge, you can also assign an <span class="Bold"><a href="../../power_data/rates_and_codes/accessorial_codes.htm">Accessorial Code</a></span> and have charges calculated based on the rate that was used for the shipment.</li>
        <li>You can manually assign a <span class="Bold"><a href="../../power_data/25_payment/general_ledger_codes.htm">General Ledger Code</a></span> to the shipment cost, which will be carried through during the allocation process.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: For NFRCs, General Ledger Codes can be automatically assigned to each cost record via a <a href="../../../job/non_freight_related_charge_rule.htm">Non-Freight Related Charge Rule</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Select a <span class="Bold">Payment Method Code</span>. A Payment Method Codes specifies how the invoice is to be paid. The options available depend on what Payment Methods you have set up in Power Data.</li>
        <li>Assign the cost an <span class="Bold"><a href="../../power_data/25_payment/adjustment_reasons.htm">Adjustment Reason</a></span> to specify why a cost adjustments was made. This will be carried through the financials process and passed along to both the customer bill and the carrier invoice.</li>
        <li>If you have added the <a href="../../../general/about_flex_fields.htm">flex fields</a> <span class="Bold">User-defined Attribute</span>,Â <span class="Bold">User-defined Attribute Number</span>,Â <span class="Bold">User-defined Attribute Date</span>, andÂ <span class="Bold">User-defined Attribute CurrencyÂ </span>via the <a href="../../../manager_layout/ml_identification.htm">manager layout</a>, they will be displayed. Enter appropriate values in the fields.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="association" id="association"></a>Shipment Cost References</h2>
      <p>Use this gridÂ to associate a shipment cost to specific Order release line items, Order releases, and Shipment stops for <a href="../../order_manager/order_rel_actions/allocate_order_rel.htm">allocation</a> purposes.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="Bold">Shipment Cost Qualifier ID:</span> Select the shipment cost qualifier from the drop-down list. Allowed values are Order release line items, Order releases, and Shipment stops.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Shipment Cost Reference ID:</span> Select the shipment cost reference from the drop-down list. The list of shipment cost references appears based on the selected shipment cost qualifier.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="Bold">Save</span> for each qualifier you specify.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If all three types of cost references are defined for the shipment cost, then the shipment costÂ will be associatedÂ with only one of them during allocation as per the below priority order:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="Bold">Order Release Line</span>:Â <span>Use the<span>Â </span></span><span>Order Release Line </span><span>to associate a shipment cost to specific order release line. The cost</span><span><span>Â will be <span><span>allocated</span></span> to related order or order line.</span></span></li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Order Release</span>:Â <span>Use the<span>Â </span></span><span>Order Release </span><span>to associate a shipment cost to specific order releases. The cost</span><span><span>Â will be <span><span>allocated</span></span> to the specified <span>order or to all related order lines</span>.</span></span></li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Shipment Stop</span>: <span>Use the<span>Â </span></span><span>Shipment StopÂ </span><span>to associate a shipment cost to specific Shipment Stops. The cost</span><span><span>Â will be allocated to all the related order or order lines.</span></span></li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a name="remarks" id="remarks"></a>Remarks</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>You can add <a href="../../../general/remarks.htm">remarks</a> to the shipment cost. This section allows you to log any extraneous information you want to keep with the cost.
