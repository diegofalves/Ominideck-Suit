    <div role="main">
      <p>This page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Shipment Management &gt; Shipment Management &gt; Shipment Ship Unit</span>. Use this page to view and/or edit existing ship units.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If you are editing an existing ship unit, the <span class="Bold">Ship Unit ID</span> field will be populated with the ID.</p>
      <h2>Adding A Shipment Ship Unit</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter the number of ship units by entering a value in the <span class="Bold">Ship Unit Count</span> field. The ship unit count acts as a multiplier for the weight or volume of the units. For example, if the ship unit weight is 10 pounds and the ship unit count is 3, then the total weight of the ship units is 30 pounds.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Transport Handling Unit</span> defines the type of packaging for the ship unit. For example, you can choose one of the public transport handling units such as a pallet, box, tote, and so on. The details of these are defined in Power Data and include attributes such as length, width, height, gross weight, tare weight, and effective volume which defines capacity. Since the defaults are considered public data, you cannot modify the attributes. However, you can define your own in <a href="../power_data/25_general/ship_unit_spec.htm">power data</a>.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Total Gross Weight/Volume per Ship Unit</span> displays weight/volume that would include all product and packaging weight per ship unit. Gross weight/volume is typically used for transportation planning. It may be used for rating in most cases.</li>
        <li>Select a <span class="Bold"><a href="../../field_definitions/flexible_commodity_qualifier.htm">flexible commodity qualifier</a></span> to describe the content of your order in terms of a specific classification.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Total Net Weight/Volume per Ship Unit</span> displays the weight/volume of a product without any handling units or packaging. For some shippers this includes the weight/volume of the carton. However, the net weight/volume may define the quantity of usable product. In all cases, it does not include the weight/volume of the ship unit such as a pallet.</li>
        <li>Enter the <span class="Bold">Length per Ship Unit</span>, <span class="Bold">Weight per Ship Unit</span>, and <span class="Bold">Height per Ship Unit</span> for the material and choose a unit of measure for each. Note that the Ship Unit Count field acts as a multiplier for the Weight and Volume fields. The value you enter for weight applies for a single ship unit. For example, if the ship unit weight is 10 pounds and the ship unit count is 3, then the total weight is 30 pounds.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Priority</span> displays the priority used in equipment packing (derived from the Ship Unit &gt; Ship Unit Spec &gt; Packaged Item &gt; Item hierarchy). This helps in understanding what priority is used when analyzing the shipments.</li>
        <li>If the ship unit is cylindrical, you can specify its overall <span class="Bold">Diameter</span> and <span class="Bold">Core Diameter</span>. These values are used in <a href="../power_data/load_configuration/load_configuration.htm">load configuration</a> evaluations.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Range Start</span> and <span class="Bold">Range End</span> values associated with the ship unit indicate the start and end numbers of the ship unit count and are useful when the ship unit count is greater than one.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Bulk Splittable</span> checkbox determines whether a ship unit with a quantity of 0 or 1 can be split into multiple ship units and placed on multiple shipments or multiple equipment.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Count Splittable</span> checkbox applies when the ship unit count is 2 or more. If it is selected, you can split one or more (but not all) ship unit pieces of this ship unit. If not selected, you cannot split by piece.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: For Visibility and Supply Chain Event Management (SCEM) purposes, it is important to track the amount ordered versus the amount booked versus the amount shipped versus the amount received. In order to manage all of these amounts, Oracle Transportation Management has the notion of the amount received of the product.</p>
        </li>
        <li>If you will permit repacking of ship units, select the <span class="Bold">Allow Repack</span> option. Repacking will only be done if a cheaper option is found.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If the shipment ship unit has a ship unit count greater than 1, you will not be able to select this option. Additionally, if for some reason (for example, thru integration etc) the ship unit count is more than 1 and the <span class="Bold">Allow Repack</span> option is selected, it will be treated as fixed packing during the planning process. If the shipment ship unit has a back pointer to a ship unit with a count higher than 1, shipment ship unit cannot be repacked.</p>
        </li>
        <li><a id="received"></a>The <span class="Bold">Received</span> fields can be used to record the appropriate received values for the ship unit in terms of gross/net weight and volume, as well as count. You can enter these values here or you can set up an <a href="../../agent_manager/agent_actions_by_object/buy_shipment_agent_actions.htm">agent</a> that can copy these values from <a href="../../execution/25_shipment_status/add_shipment_tracking_event.htm">shipment tracking events</a> that are recorded for the shipment. These are stored at the ship unit level. The received amounts are not used in the calculation of the rating engine. They are used for visibility and alerting. This provides the ability to look at the amount that was shipped versus the amount that was received. Generally, the received amount is entered by one of the trading partners and not the logistics planner.
          <br>
          These values are not used in shipment planning or rating; they are only used for information.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Order Release Ship Unit ID</span> displays the ship unit ID from the order release that was used to create this shipment ship unit for reference. This field is blank if the shipment was not planned from an order release.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Order Configuration ID</span> field allows you to specify an order configuration to define how the calculation should be performed. This will be the configuration used to guide shipment ship unit building. If the shipment ship unit does not have an order configuration defined, and if the <a href="../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm">USE OR ORDER CONFIGURATION FOR SSU CALCULATION</a> parameter is set to False, the default Order Configuration ID defined in the Shipment parameter <a href="../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm">DEFAULT ORDER CONFIG FOR SHIPMENT SHIP UNIT</a> will be used for the calculation and propagation.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If there are more than one order release ship unit line and all refer to the same order configuration and the <a href="../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm">USE OR ORDER CONFIGURATION FOR SSU CALCULATION</a> parameter is set to True, then the specified order configuration will be used. If there are multiple configurations defined on the order release ship unit lines and this parameter is set to true, each shipment ship unit will be calculated individually.</p>
        </li>
        <li>When a Ship Unit is no longer referenced in a shipment, the assignment of the ship unit to the shipment equipment on the shipment is removed, provided that the shipment equipment is not used on another shipment. The initial value of the ShipmentStopDetail.IsPermanent property when the shipment is created through planning is defined by the CREATE PERMANENT SHIP UNITS <a href="../power_data/planning/planning_parameters.htm">parameter</a>.</li>
        <li>Enter <span class="Bold"><a href="../../field_definitions/tags.htm">Tags</a></span>.</li>
        <li><span class="Bold">Fixed ERU Count</span> indicates whether the system uses Equipment Reference Units (ERU) defined on the shipment ship unit or the ERU is derived from orders. Â The Fixed ERU Count checkbox allows you to preserve the Â ERUs which you edited on shipment ship unit.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a id="Ship_Unit_Equipment_Reference_Unit"></a>Ship Unit Equipment Reference Unit</h2>
      <p>You can select ERU to limit the number of specific units being loaded on a specific Equipment Group. If any ERU level information is provided on the ship unit, it overrides any defined on the ship unit specification.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter an <span class="Bold"><a href="../power_data/25_general/equipment_reference_units.htm">Equipment Reference Unit ID</a></span>.</li>
        <li>Enter the number of reference units in the <span class="Bold">Equipment Reference Units Per Ship Unit</span> field.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Total Number of Reference Units</span> field is calculated by multiplying the equipment Reference Units Per Ship Unit field by the Ship Unit Count.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="Bold">Save</span> for each equipment reference unit you enter.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><span class="Bold">USE SHIPMENT SHIP UNIT EQUIPMENT REFERENCE UNITÂ </span></p>
      <p>If the parameter <a href="../power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm#check_equipment_capacity_in_reference_units">CHECK EQUIPMENT CAPACITY IN REFERENCE UNITS</a> is set to true:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>for all planning actions such as bulk plan, build shipment, merge shipmentÂ that involves equipment packing or equipment change, Â shipment ship unit equipment reference unit records will be created either from shipment ship unitâs order ship unit or keeps the shipment ship unit equipment reference unit when Fixed ERU Count on shipment ship unit is true.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>if Fixed ERU Count is true on shipment ship unit, the equipment reference units defined on this ship unit will be used during container optimization packing. If Fixed ERU count is false, equipment reference units from order ship units are used during container optimization packing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>if Fixed ERU Count is true, Â the shipment ship units equipment reference unit records will be kept on planned or unplanned order movements along with its shipment ship unit. Â If Fixed ERU Count is false, the shipment ship units equipment reference unit records will be removed from its shipment ship unit when order movement is unplanned.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
