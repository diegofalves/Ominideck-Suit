  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Rate Offering Type</span></h1>
  <div role="main">
    <p>This page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Contract and Rate Management &gt; Power Data &gt; Contracts &gt; Rate Offering Type</span>.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: This page is for advanced users only.</p>
    <p>You can define a new Rate Offering Type, control what fields appear in the <a href="../../rate_manager/create_rate_offering.htm">Rate Offering Manager</a>, and define the order in which rate attributes are used when calculating cost. The offering type determines what attributes are available for a rate offering.</p>
    <p>A service provider is not required for the following rate offering types because of the attributes associated with them: LTL-BASE, LTL-SMC, and AIR-TACT-RATE.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Enter a <span class="Bold">Rate Offering Type ID</span>.</li>
      <li>Enter a <span class="Bold">Rate Offering Type Name</span>.</li>
      <li>Use the <span class="Bold">Geography Base Type</span> field to specify<span class="Bold">:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>Lane - the offering type is lane-based</li>
          <li>Zone - the offering type is zone-based</li>
          <li>XDock - the offering type is cross dock-based.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Enter the <span class="Bold">Rate Attribute ID</span> you want to associate with the Rate Offering Type ID. These associations control what fields appear in the <a href="../../rate_manager/create_rate_offering.htm">Rate Offering Manager</a> after you select an Offering Type.
        <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: If you are defining a rate offering type to use the RatewareXL rating engine, both <span class="Bold">Rate Attribute ID</span> fields on this page must be set to EXTERNALRATINGENGINE.</p>
      </li>
      <li>In the <span class="Bold">Sequence Number</span> field, enter an integer to set the order in which Oracle Transportation Management applies the Rate Attribute when calculating costs. Oracle Transportation Management applies the Rate Attribute with the lowest sequence number first.<br>
        <br>
        For instance, if a shipment costs $150 plus a $60 accessorial fee, and there is a minimum charge of $200, use the sequence number to ensure that the accessorial fee of $60 is applied first for a total cost of $210. If the minimum charge is applied before the accessorial fee, a charge of $200 plus $60 would be applied for a total cost of $260.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rate Basis options you can use to construct rates. Use this section to configure only those rate basis options that you want to appear as available choices in the list fields that appear on the Rate Cost page for Rate Record. By default all rate basis options appear for most of the Public Rate Offering Types with the exception of NON-GEOGRAPHY which is configured to display only those rate basis options that support that rate offering type. If you have administrator access you can edit any of the public rate offering types and configure which rate basis options you want to appear. Select each rate basis option and save it in the grid.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    You can also configure the rate basis description that appears in the list using the <a href="raterec_costoper.htm">Rate Record Cost Operand</a>.
    <h2><a name="standard" id="standard"></a>Standard Rate Offering Types</h2>
    <p>The rate offering type determines what kind of rate you are creating. Remember that a Rate Offering Type has no inherent meaning. It is defined by the Rate Attributes joined to it. Without attributes it is not valid for rating. Rate Attributes can be combined into an Offering Type. We have done that &quot;as examples&quot; for a few public Rate Offering Types.</p>
    <h3><a name="Air" id="Air"></a>AIR</h3>
    <p>Select this rate offering type if you want to set rates for air travel. Air travel includes passenger, commercial, and cargo planes. Oracle Transportation Management also uses this data in planning to create shipments that require air transportation.</p>
    <h3>DEMURRAGE</h3>
    <p>Used when defining <a href="../../rate_manager/demurrage_rule.htm">demurrage rules</a>.</p>
    <h3>HANDLING</h3>
    <p>Use Handling to define charges incurred by time spent at a cross-dock or consolidation pool. Some cross-docks and pools charge for their services. Select Handling here, and then set an exact charge in the rate record.</p>
    <h3>INTRMDL</h3>
    <p>Intermodal has the same attributes as TL. Although this is the same as TL, you can configure them to be different and that is easier if they are different Rate Offering Types from the beginning.</p>
    <h3><a name="LTL" id="LTL"></a>LTL (Less Than Truck Load)</h3>
    <p>A quantity of freight less than that required for the application of a truckload rate. Usually less than 10,000 pounds and generally involves the use of terminal facilities (such as cross-docks and consolidation pools) to break and consolidate shipments. Discounts cannot be used with this rate offering type. To apply a discount to an LTL rate, you must select LTL-Base instead (see below).</p>
    <p>LTL rates are usually weight-based and depend on moving the shipment from one place to another. For example, one rate may be charged from New York City to Philadelphia, and another rate could then be charged for moving the shipment from Philadelphia to Los Angeles.</p>
    <p>LTL rates use two Rate Offering and Offering Types (LTL-Base, LTL-Master) to handle the typical LTL rating setup which involves a standard LTL tariff (LTL-Base) that has a discount applied (LTL-Master). Â The LTL-Base Offering type is meant to store or link to an external rating source like SMC3 to provide the standard undiscounted LTL costs information. The LTL-Master Offering Type is linked to an LTL-Base Offering Type and is where you define the discount against the LTL-Base rate offering.</p>
    <h3><a name="LTL-Base" id="LTL-Base"></a>LTL-BASE</h3>
    <p>LTL-Base (LTL-Base, LTL-SMC, or ROADWAY-TIMECRITICAL) defines the undiscounted base cost for your LTL shipments source for your LTL rate records. This is typically the undiscounted base tariff that you use for your LTL costing. The LTL-Master which links to an LTL-Base is where you define the discounts to apply to your LTL-Base.</p>
    <p>LTL Base is the parent of a rate record where you enter LTL costs. After creating a rate offering of type LTL-Base, you must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Â create another rate offering with a type of LTL-Master</li>
      <li>Â associate the LTL-Master to the LTL-Base via the Rate Attributes page.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The LTL-Master rate contains the discount.</p>
    <h3><a name="LTL-Master" id="LTL-Master"></a>LTL-MASTER</h3>
    <p>The LTL-Master links to an LTL-Base and is where you manage the discounts to your LTL-Base rates. .</p>
    <p>By default, the National Motor Freight Classification (NMFC) used and the weight used for rating an LTL shipments are assumed to be on the lines. There is a rate attribute &quot;SMC RATE SHIP UNITS&quot; that, if set, allows you to use the ship unit weight instead of line item weights whenever there is a National Motor Freight Classification (NMFC) code supplied directly on the ship unit. If the ship unit does not have an NMFC code, the rating engine will use the lines for that particular shipment. This is used when the SMC3 rating link encounters a Master or Base rate whose rate offering type includes the above specified rate attribute.</p>
    <h3><a name="LTL-SMC" id="LTL-SMC"></a>LTL-SMC</h3>
    <p>LTL-SMC is a special LTL-Base designed to pull rate costs from an external rating engine called RatewareXL (referred to as SMC3) instead of you defining them on the Rate Costs page. See <a href="../../../configuration/set_up_an_smc_rate.htm">How to Set Up an SMC3 Rate.</a></p>
    <p>Rateware performs rate lookups and calculations while using multiple tariff tables. Oracle Transportation Management can request those rates and make them part of rate offerings within the <a href="../../rate_manager/rating_engine.htm">rate manager</a>.</p>
    <p>There is a rate attribute &quot;SMC RATE SHIP UNITS&quot; that, if set, allows you to use the ship unit weight instead of line item weights whenever there is a National Motor Freight Classification (NMFC) code supplied directly on the ship unit. If the ship unit does not have an NMFC code, the rating engine will use the lines for that particular shipment. This is used when the SMC3 rating link encounters a Master or Base rate whose rate offering type includes the above specified rate attribute.</p>
    <h3>LTL-TIERED</h3>
    <p>The same as LTL except that it allows for tiered rating.</p>
    <h3>NON-GEOGRAPHY</h3>
    <p>Only use this rate offering type to model rates that support <a href="../../../job/non_freight_related_charge.htm">Non-Freight Related Charges</a> that are assigned to a job. This type of rate will have no geography attributes specified on the rate record and the rate cost should not use detailed shipment rate basis options that cover attributes such as shipment stop, shipment equipment, distance, etc., since non-freight related charges are created as shipments that do have this data.</p>
    <h3><a name="Rail" id="Rail"></a>RAIL</h3>
    <p>Use Rail if this rate covers train travel. Rail rates are typically weight-based and depend upon moving from one place to another.</p>
    <p>Rail rates are almost always based on commodity because of the marketing department assignments at major carriers. The most common commodities moved by rail are automotive (vehicles and parts), coal and heavy minerals, agricultural products, chemicals, forest products (paper, lumber, misc. box car), metals (steel), and intermodal. The way each group gets credit for their sales is by product codes that are required for shipping. These are the <a href="../item_classifications/stcc.htm">STCC codes</a>. STCC is Standard Commodity Classification Codes. Intermodal rates are usually per container or trailer rates since the commodity is typically FAK (freight all kinds).</p>
    <p>Rates for commodities may be regulated by the government. Public rates for regulated commodities are called tariffs. Private rates for commodities are contracts. Contracts are always cheaper than tariffs since there is a negotiation for a better rate depending on some annual volume guarantee. Rates for non-regulated commodities are published in Circulars and special deals that can be done instantly are called quotes. These quotes are confidential and do not have to be publicly disclosed. There is some blurring between a quote and a non-regulated contract as some quotes can cover long term deals.</p>
    <p>Rail rates are usually set up in one of the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Origin to Destination</li>
      <li>Region to Region</li>
      <li>Zip Code to Zip Code</li>
      <li>Mileage Based</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The actual area covered by this rate and the cost are defined within an associated rate record.</p>
    <h3>ROADWAY-TIMECRITICAL</h3>
    <p>ROADWAY-TIMECRITICAL is a kind of LTL-Base that pulls rate costs from Roadway&#39;s web-based LTL rating engine.</p>
    <p>Roadway&#39;s engine can rate line items using NMFC classification codes only, and only for LTL and Time Critical LTL shipments. Time critical rates are those with required pickup and delivery time constraints.</p>
    <h3>ROADWAY-TIMECRITICAL GUAR</h3>
    <p>Reserved for future use.</p>
    <h3>SPOT</h3>
    <p>Use spot rates to create rates quickly. Creating a spot rate is quicker than creating normal rates, since the entry screen is simpler. However, these rates are still saved to the database as real rates, but flagged as spot rates. They can be turned into real rates by copying the rate record and selecting a valid rate offering type. The new Spot Rate page incorporates all the elements of the current multi-tab entry into one screen. It also enables you to add remarks and reference numbers.</p>
    <p>To <a href="../../order_manager/quote/creating_a_spot_rate.htm">create spot rates</a>, you need a service provider and a rate offering with a rate offering type of &quot;Spot rate&quot;. Creating a spot rate prompts you for the service provider and the rate offering, if multiple rate offerings exist with a type of &#39;Spot rate&#39; that the spot rate is to be created against.</p>
    <h3><a name="TL" id="TL"></a>TL (Truck Load)</h3>
    <p>The truck load offering type is used for rates that only cover ground travel via vehicular transport. Truckload type transport usually connotes 48 or 53 foot equipment and uses a rating structure similar to one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Point A to point B flat rate.</li>
      <li>Area A to area B (or even Point A to area B). Areas can be defined as a state, zip range or standard point location code (SPLC) range. These can be flat rate or an applicable per mile rate that only applies to and from a particular geo hierarchy specified in the rate record.</li>
      <li>Per mile. This can be defined as point or area to area or to anywhere. TL carriers often base their per mile rates on things that affect how much they want to service a given area.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>TL rates are usually weight-independent. The only restriction is that the carrier may refuse to pull a load if it is overweight. 46,000 pounds of freight is the usual limit in the US, and some areas of Canada allow for loads up to 80,000 pounds. If the shipment meets these restrictions, then weight is usually not taken into account when assigning cost. You are in essence paying to rent the entire truck or trailer. The shipment goes from your door to the consignee&#39;s door. If your shipment does not fill an entire truck or trailer, consider using an LTL (see below) rate instead.</p>
    <h3>TL-TIERED</h3>
    <p>The same as TL except that it allows for <a href="../../../configuration/configure_tiered_rating.htm">tiered rating</a>.</p>
    <h3><a name="Vessel" id="Vessel"></a>VESSEL</h3>
    <p>Use this offering type to set rates from one port to another port. Vessel rates are usually set up as a flat rate, but this may vary since space is usually reserved on the boat for each package or container, and you must pay for the space even if you do not get to the dock in time to ship your items.</p>
    <h3><a name="Zone-Based" id="Zone-Based"></a>ZONE-BASED</h3>
    <p>Select this type to create zone-based rates. Typically, zone-based rates cover shipments up to 150 pounds and are based on moving from one zone to another, as defined by you or the carrier. For example, if you want to create a rate that is applicable for travel from anywhere on the West Coast to anywhere on the East Coast, you would select this rate offering type, and then select the applicable rate zone when you create your rate record.</p>
