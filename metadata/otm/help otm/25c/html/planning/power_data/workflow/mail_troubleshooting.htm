    <p><a id="guide_Mail_Validation_Troubleshooting"></a>This page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Business Process Automation &gt; Power Data &gt; Mail Management &gt; Mail Validation</span>.</p>
    <p>When <a href="mail_validation.htm">validating your ability send email</a>, you may encounter different error codes. Use this page to research what the errors mean, and how to fix them.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Make a note of the <span class="Bold">Mail Log ID</span>, and the From and To emails, and be prepared to share that information with Support. Log IDs may be reused after 2 days.</p>
    <h2>Diagnosing Mail Validation Errors</h2>
    <p>The following tables describe each mail validation error, its causes and recommended resolution steps.</p>
    <p>Many of the resolutions include preparing a mail log for request for Oracle Support. To do this:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Take note of the validation inputs. I.e., collect the From address (if running from Mail Senders) and the To address and Subject (if running from Mail Validation).</li>
      <li>Take note of the Mail Log ID listed on the Mail Validation results frame.</li>
      <li>Go to the Collect Diagnostic Logs screen. Select the Mail log in the additional Logs selection. Submit.</li>
      <li>Take note of the archive name.</li>
      <li>Open a support ticket including the validation inputs from #1, the Mail Log ID from #2 and the archive name from #4.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This will enable the mail log for your validation test to be correctly uploaded for Support review. It should contain all Oracle Cloud, DNS and Oracle Transportation Management information needed to proceed with issue analysis.</p>

This permits all from parties in that domain to act as mail senders in Oracle Mail. Note that the Approved Domain registration will fail unless all DKIM checks below pass.</p>
            <p>If this fails, it is likely another division or a partner organization is already using the From address or Approved Domain. Only one organization may use a Mail Sender at a time, excluding Common Senders. Please prepare a mail log request for Oracle support and open a Service Request to resolve proper usage of the From address.</p>

            <p>Sender Policy Framework (SPF) has not been set up for the senderâs email domain.</p>
            <p>This occurs because a query for DNS TXT records in the sender domain found no records matching Section 3 in the RFC 7208 specification for SPF. I.e., no TXT record has a string value beginning with âv=spf1â.</p>

            <p>While SPF may not be required in your or a partnerâs organization, Oracle recommends it be added to reduce the chance of spamming and fraudulent emails. SPF is not always needed for successful sending of email message but specific mail accounts or receiving systems may require it.Â </p>
            <p>After adding an SPF record for the email domain, you must wait for it to propagate across DNS. This may take up to 72 hours for worldwide notification of your TXT addition to be available to Oracle validation. Once this time has passed, repeat the mail validation.</p>
            <p>If there is a valid SPF record for the email sender domain in DNS, or the mail validation continues to fail after SPF addition, prepare a mail log request for Oracle support and open a Service Request to investigate further. Â </p>

            <p>Work with your (or your partnerâs) DNS administrator to add the email server to the SPF TXT record as an authorized sender (e.g. +include:&lt;oracle server&gt;). Take care not to remove other approved servers outside of Oracle.Â </p>
            <p>Ask your DNS administrator for the Time To Live (TTL) on the DNS TXT record. You should not retry the validation until the time to live has expired and all publicly cached records are updated. This is typically 12 or 24 hours.</p>
            <p>Note that outbound e-mails are often successfully received even if SPF directs mailbox providers to soft bounce emails from this sender. It is the decision of each mailbox provider how to handle SPF instructions. Soft bounces, however, may result in the mailbox provider blocking or quarantining emails. It is good practice to correctly set up the SPF record of each sender domain to accept emails from Oracle Mail servers without bounce.</p>
            <p>If the problem persists after TTL, prepare a mail log request for Oracle support and open a Service Request to analyze the source of the soft bounce. Â </p>

            <p>Note that outbound e-mails may be temporarily successful even if SPF directs mailbox providers to hard bounce emails from this sender. Rules within Oracle Mail determine when a sufficient volume of hard bounce responses force a suppression of mail to a particular recipient. If hard bounces are not resolved, it is likely that recipients will not receive their emails and end up on the Mail Suppression list.

            <p>DNS lookups for domain {domain} have timed out after {timeout} seconds. SPF setup cannot be validated at this time. This is likely due to Time to Live (TTL) timeouts on cached DNS information, followed by a slow refresh from your DNS provider. Depending on recipient mailboxes, this may cause mail quarantine, rejection and/or Oracle Mail suppression. Please work with your DNS administrator to determine the underlying cause of DNS query delays.</p>
          </td>
          <td>
            <p>Internet mail servers cache DNS information for your domain, including SPF details, on local servers. This can include application servers, mail servers and mailbox hosts. When the SPF Time-To-Live (TTL) value expires, these caches must be flushed. This forces these servers to retrieve DNS information directly from your DNS provider, adding network latency to the data retrieval.</p>

            <p>The default timeout for DNS checks in Mail Validation is 10 seconds. This can be configured with the property:</p>

              <li><a href="../../../properties/glog/dns.properties.htm">glog.dns.timeout</a>=&lt;timeout in milliseconds&gt;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While this error can be resolved by increasing this timeout, there are three cases to consider:</p>
            <ol>

            <p>While these features may not be required in your or a partnerâs organization, Oracle recommends enabling them to ensure reliable delivery of your email and guarantee proper validation of generated email messages.</p>
            <p>To begin DKIM configuration, go to the Mail Domains screen and add the email domain. This will prompt you for a unique organization name and build a DKIM selector based on the cloud region and date.</p>
            <p>Up to two DKIM entries are automatically added for use with your DNS (this depends on whether you opt into AUTOMATIC DKIM ROTATION). This allows Mail Delivery to automatically rotate DKIM keys without additional configuration required in your DNS domain. Work with your DNS administrator to add CNAME records based on the values in the DNSÂ subscreen.</p>
            <p>To begin Return Path configuration, go to the <a href="mail_domains.htm">Mail Domains</a> screen and select Return Path on the domain to add a custom return path. Note that this will first require DKIM be fully verified.

            <p>The custom return path is a subdomain underneath the email domain that Â receives notifications when mail is refused by recipient mailboxes. These notifications are sent to email addresses within the subdomain using a VERP envelope address, encapsulating the original email recipient into the address recipient in the return path subdomain.</p>
            <p>Note that Mail Delivery is not blocked while using the default return path. If, however, DMARC rules are implemented for the domain, some mailboxes may reject email due to failure of DMARC alignment checks.</p>

    <h2>SMTP Validation Passes but Email Not Received</h2>
    <p>There are many reasons why the above SMTP check may pass but e-mails are not received:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mailbox providers may be configured to reject certain senders or recipients, sending the mail to Spam folders, quarantining the messages or rejecting the messages with a bounce.Â </li>
      <li>Mailbox providers may be configured to reject certain sender domains, similarly sending mail to spam, quarantine or bounce.</li>
      <li>Mailbox providers or domains may require SPF or DKIM. The failure of SPF or DKIM below may not stop Oracle Mail from distributing mail. But receiving systems or domains may reject these messagesÂ due to the lack mail protection.</li>
      <li>If the SMTP check below passes, it means Oracle Transportation Management successfully sent out an e-mail to Oracle Mail. However, the system has no way to confirm the e-mail was received by the ultimate mailbox provider, nor that it can be viewed by the email user.Â </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To determine if the mail message was correctly forwarded and accepted by the mailbox provider (e.g. Gmail), Oracle Mail supports a new feature: Email Logging. This provides additional detail as to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the relaying of emails to the mailbox provider</li>
      <li>notification if the email was delivered or bounced</li>
      <li>notification if the email was marked as spam</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Work with Oracle Mail support to enable these logs if such detail is required. Â </p>
