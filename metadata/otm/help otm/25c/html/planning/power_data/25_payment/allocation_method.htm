      <p>This page gives you the ability to define allocation methods by cost type. Once you have defined allocation methods, you can use them in the <a href="../../../settlement/allocation_rule_manager/alloc_rule_mgr_overview.htm">Allocation Rule Manager</a>.</p>
      <h2>Defining an Allocation Method</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Allocation Method ID</span> uniquely identifies a defined method. The IDs of saved methods cannot be edited.</li>
        <li>Select the basis (Line, Order Base Line, or Order) to which this allocation method will apply.</li>
        <li>Enter a brief description of the method in the <span class="Bold">Description</span> field.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Use Shipment Ship Unit</span> option if that applies to the method you are defining. Use this checkbox when you want to get the metrics from the shipment ship unit rather than the shipment ship unit line.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Allocation by means of shipment ship unit is used when an existing shipment ship unit line lacks <a href="alloc_metric_defns.htm">metric</a> details.

The departure and arrival time are taken from the shipment stop, where a ship unit is picked up and dropped off respectively.</p>
              <p>Note: The dwell time metric is applicable for order level and not at line level. The Use Shipment Ship Unit checkbox will not have any impact on the dwell time calculation.</p>

        <li>Select a metric from the <span class="Bold">Metric</span> drop-down list. The contents of the list depend on what you chose in Step 2 above. The formula for calculating the allocation is as follows:
          <br>
          (Order, Order Base Line, or Order Release Line Metric value/Total Metric value) * (Weighted Percent/100) * Cost
          <br>
          <br>
          Order, Order Base Line, or Order Release Line Metric value -Â Â The metric value of an order or order release line is always fetched from shipment ship unit line(s) corresponding to an order or order release line. If the Use Shipment Ship Unit checkbox on the allocation method is checked, then OTM will get the metric value from the shipment ship unit corresponding to the order or order release line. The metric value for an order base line is fetched from the order base line itself and not from ship unit lines. Metric value is as defined by the metric; either weight or volume or piece count, carried distance, and so on.
          <br>
          <br>
          Total Metric value - Sum of metric values of all the order, order base line, or order release lines corresponding to a shipment, voucher, or bill.
          <br>
          <br>
          Cost - The total cost of the shipment, voucher or bill. If you want to see the total allocated cost for an order, order base line, or order release line, use the total cost of shipment, voucher or bill. If you want to see how each individual cost of the shipment, voucher or bill is allocated to an order, order base line, or order release line, use the individual cost here. </li>
        <li>Enter an identifier in the<span class="Bold"> Equipment Reference Unit ID</span> field if you are defining an allocation method based on any ERU metric..</li>
        <li>Enter a percent for the selected basis in the <span class="Bold">Percentage</span> field.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="Bold">Save</span>.</li>
        <li>Continue entering allocation method details by repeating Steps 1-3. Remember that the percentages must total 100. For example, if you selected a line item-based weight metric of 90 percent, the other metrics for planned line item allocation must add up to ten percent, for a total of 100 percent.</li>
