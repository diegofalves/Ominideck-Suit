  <div role="main">
    <p>This page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Contract and Rate Management &gt; Contract Management &gt; Rate Record</span><span class="Bold">.</span> Then select the <span class="Bold">Rate Costs</span> tab<span class="Bold">.</span> Click <span class="Bold">Add a Cost</span>. Then click the drop-down list for <span class="Bold">Basis</span>.</p>
    <h2><span class="Bold"><a name="naming" id="naming"></a>Naming Conventions</span></h2>
    <p>A rate basis item is a piece of data from a shipment such as total weight, total volume, distance traveled, number of stops, etc.</p>
    <p>It is also a description of how to retrieve aggregate shipment data, such as the order release reference number or the packaged item ID from a ship unit picked up at the source. Aggregate objects are accessed in a loop.</p>
    <p>Basically, everything starts with the shipment; from there, to the related object to get the detail.</p>
    <h3>SELECT</h3>
    <p>Sometimes you might need a simple sub-total for a condition or a cost. For example, you need to charge a cost, but only if the shipment has more than 10 ship units whose total weight is more than 50 pounds. For this a SELECT operator is used. The SELECT operator tells the rating engine to run it&#39;s main loop multiple times. Each object that fails the condition is excluded from the next run of the main loop. A select RBI, for example &#39;Shipment SELECT Weight&#39;, only totals up using sub-objects that were not excluded by the previous condition.</p>
    <h4><span class="Bold">Conditional Example with Select:</span></h4>
    <p>The &#39;select&#39; functionality for conditional RBIs can be useful in limited circumstances. For example, you may have a rate that is conditional on a conditional subset of shipment information. You may want to charge a penalty cost if the total weight of the ship units being picked up at a particular stop is greater than a certain amount. You would set the cost up as follows:</p>
    <p>Conditional:</p>
    <p><span class="Code">STOP LOCATION ID = &#39;MYLOCATION&#39;</span></p>
    <p><span class="Code">AND &#39;Stop Activity&#39; = &#39;P&#39;</span></p>
    <p><span class="Code">SELECT &#39;Shipment SELECT Weight&#39; &gt;= 1000 LB</span></p>
    <p>Charge:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>$495 per SHIPMENT</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The SELECT logical operator instructs the rating engine to perform multiple loops through the shipment data. In this case, it performs a loop through the ship units by stops, and marks all of the picked-up ship units at the stop &#39;MYLOCATION&#39; as being included in the result set. Then, the rating engine loops through the shipment data again, this time using the &#39;Shipment SELECT Weight&#39; RBI, which calculates the shipment total weight based on only the ship units included in the selected result set.</p>
    <p>Suppose you have two shipments:</p>
    <table title="example Table">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <p>Shipment 1</p>

          <th>
            <p>Shipment 2</p>
          </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>Pick up from MYLOCATION</p>
            <p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ship Unit 1 = 500 lbs.</p>
            <p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ship Unit 2 = 300 lbs.</p>
            <p>Pick up from YOURLOCATION</p>
            <p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ship Unit 3 = 400 lbs.</p>
            <p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ship Unit 4 = 100 lbs.</p>
            <p>Deliver all four ship units to DELIVERYLOCATION</p>
          </td>
          <td>
            <p>Pick up from MYLOCATION</p>
            <p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ship Unit 1 = 500 lbs.</p>
            <p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ship Unit 2 = 500 lbs.</p>
            <p>Pick up from YOURLOCATION</p>
            <p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ship Unit 3 = 400 lbs.</p>
            <p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ship Unit 4 = 100 lbs.</p>
            <p>Deliver all four ship units to DELIVERYLOCATION</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Â </p>
    <p>Shipment 1 would not incur the $495 shipment charge because the SELECT function will sum only the ship units being picked up from location MYLOCATION for evaluation. Although the entire shipment carries 1300 lbs., the weight being picked up at MYLOCATION is only 800 lbs., which is less than the 1000 lbs. specified by the condition.</p>
    <p>By contrast, Shipment 2 would incur the $495 shipment charge because the sum of the ship units at location MYLOCATION is 1,000 lbs., which satisfies the specified condition.</p>
    <h2><a name="rbi" id="rbi"></a>Rate Basis Items</h2>
    <p>Following is the list of RBIs. Type refers to from where the RBI can be selected. &quot;Conditional&quot; means it is available to be selected as a rate basis item in the &quot;Conditions&quot; section of a rate cost. &quot;Charge&quot; means it is available to be selected as a rate basis item in the &quot;Charge&quot; section of a rate cost and &quot;Both&quot; means it is available to be selected as a rate basis item in both the&quot;Conditional&quot; and &quot;Charge&quot; sections of a rate cost.</p>
    <p>Starting in 6.1, we list the version to which new RBIs were added. The ones noted with 6.1* were ported forward from an earlier version.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: RBIs related to time, such as SHIPMENT TOTAL TRANSIT TIME, can only be used for <a href="create_rate_service.htm">rate services</a> with a rate service type of Simulation.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Declared value RBIs such as &#39;Destination Declared Value&#39; and &#39;Line Item Declared Value&#39;, cannot be allocated to a shipment when the order is split. The declared value can only be computed when orders are consolidated into a single shipment.</p>
    <p>The <a href="../../properties/glog/business.property.htm#glog.business.rate.ratedistance.failRateOnInvalidDistance_">glog.business.rate.ratedistance.failRateOnInvalidDistance</a> property determines if OTM will still rate a shipment even if RBIs driven by distance fail.</p>

            <p>The complete round trip distance of the shipment, from source to destination and back to the source.Â This RBI can be used to determine the total mileage charges per cycle (round trip) when comparing private vs railroad. For example, you may be responsible for the return trip and cost of a rail car back to the source location.<br>
              It doubles the distance from the source to the destination. The distance between source to destination for a shipment includes all stop offs. So, if a shipment has 5 stops including the source and destination and this distance is captured on the shipment, the distance will be doubled for the return trip, assuming the same path and stops.</p>

            <p>Time duration of a particular ship unit spent at a pickup stop. This is mainly used for secondary charge shipments created on outbound shipments at a particular location. Dwell time is calculated based on the difference between the departure time of the ship unit on the outbound shipment and the arrival time of the corresponding ship unit on the inbound shipment. The departure and Â arrival time are taken from the shipment stop where a ship unit is picked up and dropped off respectively.</p>
            <p>The glog.business.secondarycharge.shipUnitDwellTimeCalc.truncateDates property calculates dwell time for secondary charge shipments. For more details about this property, see <a href="../../properties/glog/business.property.htm">glog.business Properties</a>.</p>
