    <div role="main">
      <p>This page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Order Management &gt; Hazardous Material Management &gt; Hazardous Item</span>.</p>
      <p>The Hazardous Item Manager is used to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>build a library of hazardous materials that can be assigned to shipments</li>
        <li>validate information about hazardous items contained on a shipment</li>
        <li>define precise attributes regarding hazardous materials that can be mapped to a Bill of Lading in accordance with U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) regulations</li>
        <li>provide information to a service provider about how to transport a hazardous shipment</li>
        <li>provide information to hazardous cleanup personnel in the event of a spill</li>
      </ul>
      <p>An item can be classified as hazardous because of any combination of these factors: the item itself, the packaging of the item, the mode upon which the item will be transported, and the destination region for the item. This manager is separate from the Material Manager because it provides more detailed functionality for information management of hazardous materials. Any information that appears on both the Hazardous Material window and the Hazardous Item window will be superceded by the information on the Hazardous Item window. See <a href="hazardous_material_settings_and_implications.htm">Hazardous Material Settings and Implications</a>.</p>
      <p>For example, adipic acid could be entered as a new hazardous item then assigned to an order and included for shipment to Detroit, Michigan in the USA on a 28-foot truck. This would not be a hazardous move because it did not meet the four hazardous criteria. However, if you wanted to build a shipment of adipic acid with the same move criteria except you wanted to send it to Canada instead of Detroit, it would be considered a hazardous move because of Canadian regulations.</p>
      <p>Use the Hazardous Materials Manager to enter or update information about materials designated as hazardous by the U.S. DOT, or you can create specific hazardous substances (items) with attributes of one or more hazardous materials. This manager, along with all hazardous power data pages, comprises the hazardous materials database. This database is checked when a hazardous shipment is built ensure compliance with all attributes of a hazardous item.</p>
      <p>Enter information about hazardous substances and attach hazardous material information to that substance (item). A hazardous item could be a mixture comprised of one or more hazardous materials, depending on how the materials have been created at the Hazardous Materials page.</p>
      <p>For example, you could enter information about polyethyl benzene at the Hazardous Material page and its related chemical properties (including interaction with other materials), then define a hazardous item by the same name with information required for transport and attach the Hazardous Material information to the item at this page.</p>
      <p>The purpose of entering hazardous item information, along with hazardous material information, is to create a hazardous materials database that is checked when a shipment that contains a hazardous item is built and tendered.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: It is the order owner&#39;s responsibility to document all hazardous information concerning their product to a service provider.</p>
      <p>As a reminder, here are the four criteria for determining the hazardous state of an item:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The item name (Hazardous Material Key)</li>
        <li>The package type</li>
        <li>The mode of transport</li>
        <li>The region where the hazardous item is being transported</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here is a common usage scenario where Hazardous Item information is used.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A shipment is created and shipment header information is populated, including the Hazmat Mode ID and Hazmat Region ID. Shipment line item information is also populated, including the Packaged Item ID and the Hazmat Item ID.</li>
        <li>When the shipment with the hazardous item is built, tender/accepted and ready for execution, the Hazmat Mode ID, Hazmat Region ID, Packaged Item ID and Hazmat Item ID are automatically checked against the Hazardous Materials database to ensure that the combination of the four field values makes this a hazardous item. The Can Be Hazardous checkbox should be checked for the Packaged Item also if the item can be hazardous.</li>
        <li>If the check is successful, then a Bill of Lading is printed for this shipment with the hazardous item information noted appropriately on the bill. If the check is unsuccessful, then the shipment remains at its location, an event notification is generated, and a hazardous materials representative must go to the shipment location to reconcile any discrepancies with the shipment.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a id="Hazardous Item"></a>Hazardous Item</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter a <span class="Bold">Hazmat Item ID</span> for the item. The <span class="Bold">HazRegion ID</span> specifies the region where the hazardous item is being transported. Use the finder or create a new region as necessary. Regulations for the transport of hazardous materials vary all over the world, so it is critical that you are aware of these regulations as you define your hazardous item.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Hazmat Generic ID</span> can be created here or is tied to an existing <a href="create_haz_gen_1.htm#Hazardous Material">hazardous material</a>.</li>
        <li>If checked, the <span class="Bold">Hazardous Materials Indicator</span> designates the item as hazardous on a bill of lading. The Can Be Hazardous checkbox for the item should also be checked at the Packaged Item page in the Material Manager to make sure that there is a match when the hazardous shipment is built (described in the Usage Scenario above).</li>
        <li>Marking the <span class="Bold">Hot Indicator</span> checkbox means that the hazardous item had an elevated temperature when shipped and may cool during transport. It is not a request to keep heating the product during transit.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Residue Indicator</span> checkbox indicates that, after the hazardous item is removed from its container after arriving at its destination, the empty or &quot;near empty&quot; container contains some of the product that was shipped since it would be either uneconomical or dangerous to remove all of the material (in the hazardous material industry, this residue is called a &quot;heel&quot;). When this indicator is checked, it means that the customer/consignee must ship the container back to the order owner with a hazardous residue waybill.</li>
        <li>Select <a href="../power_data/item_classifications/haz_trans_message.htm">Hazardous Transport Messages</a> or create your own at the <span class="Bold">Transport Message 1 ID</span> or <span class="Bold">Transport Message 2 ID</span> fields.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold"><a href="../power_data/rates_and_codes/transport_modes.htm">Mode</a></span> option determines whether the material is hazardous when transported by air, rail, truck, ocean, or under all modes. For example, there are some items that are hazardous for transport when moved by air or ocean, some could be hazardous when moved by rail, and some could be hazardous when moved under any mode. The default for this option is All, but you can create transport modes in Power Data specifying whether the mode of transport is a standard mode (S), hazardous mode (H), or both (B). Creating modes with qualifier options H or B will populate the drop-down list at this field.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold"><a href="../power_data/item_classifications/haz_approv_except.htm">DOT Exemption</a></span> indicates that the order owner has applied to the DOT for an exemption from the standard rules of transport and has demonstrated that an alternate method is equally as safe. The list of exemption numbers is public but the details are considered confidential.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Comp. Authority Approval</span> ID is a second exemption message that can be used because two exemptions may be required during the course of a hazardous move (e.g., the first to set a drum from an upright position onto its side, and the second to allow for plastic drums instead of metal).</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold"><a href="../power_data/item_classifications/stcc.htm">49 STCC ID</a></span> (or 49 Standard Transportation Commodity Code ID) is an industry standard that classifies all products that are being shipped. Codes that begin with the number 49 apply specifically to hazardous materials. The purpose of this field is to require that the correct 49 STCC codes are placed on the hazardous transport instructions. This does not signify a commercial classification.</li>
        <li>Enter a <span><a href="../material_manager/create_pack_info.htm">Packaged Item ID</a></span> and a <span class="Bold">Description</span> about the hazardous item.</li>

Enter a numeric value if applicable and select K for Kelvin, F for Fahrenheit, or C for Centigrade as the temperature type.</li>
        <li>Enter the temperature at which the product will begin the process of self-destructing or breaking down in the <span class="Bold">Emergency Temperature</span> field.</li>
        <li>Use the <span class="Bold">Reportable Quantity</span> checkbox and find or create an <span class="Bold"><a href="../power_data/item_classifications/haz_tech_name.htm">RQ Technical Name</a></span> for this hazardous substance. You can do this for a maximum of two names. Check the <span class="Bold">Reportable Quantity (RQ)</span> indicator if the material is composed of quantities of other chemicals that are hazardous and must be reported by concentration percentage. RQs are the chemical components of a hazardous item that have reached a threshold in a shipping container that make them reportable as hazardous items. For example, hazardous material A could be composed of 40% of chemical A1, 30% of chemical A2, 15% of chemical A3, and 15% of chemical A4. In this case, if chemicals A1 and A2 exceeded the threshold in the container and are hazardous, they would have to be specified by name as the RQs.</li>
        <li>Use the <span class="Bold">NOS</span> (Not Otherwise Specified) checkbox and find or create an <span class="Bold">NOS Technical Name</span> for this hazardous substance. You can do this for a maximum of two names.</li>
        <li>Use the <span class="Bold"><a href="create_haz_gen_1.htm#Hazardous Material">Marine Pollutant</a></span> checkbox and find or create a <span class="Bold">Marine Pollutant Technical Name</span> for this hazardous substance. You can do this for a maximum of two names.</li>
        <li>Use the <span class="Bold">Toxic Inhalation</span> checkbox and select an <span class="Bold">Inhalation Hazard Zone</span> from the drop-down list.</li>
        <li>Check the <span class="Bold">Passenger Aircraft Forbidden</span> indicator and <span class="Bold">Commercial Aircraft Forbidden</span> if there are restrictions for shipping on aircraft.</li>
        <li>Check the <span class="Bold">Oil Contained</span> indicator if the material is an oil-based product. Crude oil is not designated as a hazardous substance.</li>
        <li>Indicate if the product is a poison by selecting the <span class="Bold">Poison</span> checkbox.</li>
        <li>Enter a <span class="Bold">Proper Shipping Name Prefix</span>. This prefix is the Chemical prefix for Proper Shipping name and could be either the single letters a-, b-, m-, N-, n-, O-, o-, p-, or the prefixes alpha-, beta-, meta-, omega-, sec-, or tert-.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Activity</span> field indicates the level of radioactivity of the product.</li>
        <li>If the material is contained in a single package, select the <span class="Bold">All Packed In One</span> option.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Authorization for the Dangerous Goods</span> is used to state special governmental authorizations which may be required.</li>
