    <div role="main">
      <p>This page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Configuration and Administration &gt; User Configuration &gt; Actions Manager.</span></p>
      <p>Use the <span class="Bold">Action</span> page to perform the following tasks for actions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="configure_actions.htm#manager_layout">Create user-defined actions based on manager layouts.</a></li>
        <li><a href="#report">Configure any existing report as a user-defined action that can be run manually from the Result page Action menu of a particular business object type.</a></li>
        <li><a href="#agent">Configure any existing automation agent as a user-defined action that can be run manually from the Results page Action menu of a particular business object type.</a></li>
        <li><a href="#external">Create an action that sends an object to an external URL</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="#document">Configure any existing document as a user-defined action that can be run manually from the Results page Action menu of a particular business object type.</a></li>
        <li><a href="#action">Edit the public actions and configure attributes for actions that support attributes.</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: For every user-defined action created, you must run the <a href="../user_management/actions/manage_action_security.htm">Secure Action</a> action against that action.</p>
      <h2><a name="manager_layout" id="manager_layout"></a>Create Manager Layout-based Actions</h2>
      <p>You can create user-defined actions that are used with configured manager layouts. This enables you to rename and rearrange fields on an action to meet your businesses needs. Several steps are involved in <a href="../configuration/custom_actions.htm">creating a user-defined action</a>, including one portion of the process that is completed on the Actions Manager, as described here.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Enter an <span class="Bold">Action</span>.</li>
        <li>Enter a <span class="Bold"><a href="../translation_manager/new_translation_id.htm">Label</a></span>.</li>
        <li>Select an <span class="Bold">Action Definition ID</span>. If you selected a specific action definition, such as READY_TO_SHIP_OB_LINE, a Manager Layout section appears.</li>
        <li>Enter an <span class="Bold">Audit Action ID</span> if you want to monitor the action by using <a href="../user_access/action_checks.htm">action checks</a>.</li>
        <li>Select a <span class="Bold">Domain Name</span>.</li>
        <li><a id="long_running"></a>Select the <span class="Bold"><a href="../bpa/long_running_tasks.htm">Long Running Task</a></span> checkbox if you expect it to frequently process a large number of records. If this checkbox is selected and the Minimum Item Count is defined, the action will be considered a long running task if the minimum item count is met. All user actions check the number of objects selected to determine if a long-running threshold has been reached. E.g., if a bulk plan is run for one order, the action should not be tracked as long-running. But if a bulk plan is run for 100 orders, it could, depending on the value in the Minimum Item Count field, or the <a href="../properties/glog/action.properties.htm#glog.action.numObjectsForLongRunningTask">glog.action.numObjectsForLongRunningTask</a> property.</li>
        <li><a id="minimum_item_count"></a>Enter the <span class="Bold">Minimum Item Count</span> to qualify this action as being <a href="../bpa/long_running_tasks.htm">long-running</a>. If this field is not defined, the system defaults to the value defined in the <a href="../properties/glog/action.properties.htm#glog.action.numObjectsForLongRunningTask">glog.action.numObjectsForLongRunningTask</a> property. Any value in this field overrides that property value. See Long Running task above for more details.</li>
        <li>If you selected one of the special action definitions, choose a <span class="Bold">Manager Layout ID</span>.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="Bold">Finished</span>.</li>
        <li>Run the <span class="Bold"><a href="../user_management/actions/manage_action_security.htm">Secure Action</a></span> action against the newly-created action.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="initialization" id="initialization"></a>Initialization Arguments</h2>
      <p>These are the parameters that are passed to an action to identify specific conditions. An example is assign and unassign. Suppose that one action&#39;s definition can handle both assign and unassign. Then, this information is passed through action arguments to tell which operation needs to take place. This data comes from the CSV file, so most of the time, these are read-only. There are a few exceptions. There are a few fleet related actions such as Assign Driver to Shipment, where the FLEET_IGNORE_DISPLAY argument can be modified. By default, this argument is true, so, when it is true, OTM displays the fleet planning Ignore Criteria page for this action. If you do not want this screen to appear, you can set it to false. This is the only argument that can be changed. All other arguments are read only.</p>
      <h2><a name="report" id="report"></a>Configure Reports as Actions</h2>
      <p>Follow these steps to configure a report as a manual action. After you create a user-defined action, you need to edit or create an appropriate screen set and configure that screen set to display the new action on the Actions menu.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Name the new action in the <span class="Bold">Action</span> field. The action name will appear on the Actions tab of a screen set when you include the action on the screen set.</li>
        <li>Select a <span class="Bold"><a href="../translation_manager/new_translation_id.htm">Label</a></span> to define the text that appears on the action menu for the action. This label text also appears on the Actions list in the Screen Set Manager (Actions tab).
          <br>
          <br>
          For example, if you create an action with a Label ID that has text defined as MY ORDER REPORT, the Actions menu displays the action menu option as MY ORDER REPORT. </li>
        <li>Select one of the following <span class="Bold">Action Definition IDs</span> to configure report actions:
          <ul>
            <li>RUN_REPORT_ORDER_BASE</li>
            <li>RUN_REPORT_ORDER_RELEASE</li>
            <li>RUN_REPORT_SHIPMENT</li>
            <li>RUN_REPORT_INVOICE</li>
            <li>RUN_REPORT_SHIPMENT_FROM_TENDER (planner screen set)</li>
            <li>RUN_REPORT_SHIPMENT_FROM_TENDER_SERV (service provider screen set)</li>
          </ul>
          Your selection of an Action Definition ID determines the Screen Sets to which you can add the action. For example, if you select RUN_REPORT_ORDER_BASE, only Screen Sets assigned to an Order Base Query ID (OB_ORDER_BASE) will display the action as a valid choice on the Actions tab in the Screen Set Manager. </li>
        <li>Select a domain from the <span class="Bold">Domain Name</span> drop-down list in which to store the user-defined action (or leave the default which is the current domain).</li>
        <li>Perform a search in the <span class="Bold">Report ID</span> field and select a report from the list. The report that you select should correspond with the Agent Definition ID that you selected. For example, if you create a user-defined report action for ORDER_BASE, select an order-centric report as opposed to a report on shipments, etc.</li>
        <li>If you do not want to consolidate your reports, enter FALSE in the <span class="Bold">Consolidated</span> field. If you leave this field empty or enter TRUE, the reports will be run as if they are consolidated.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="Bold">Finished</span> to save the new action.</li>
        <li>Run the <span class="Bold"><a href="../user_management/actions/manage_action_security.htm">Secure Action</a></span> action against the newly-created action.</li>
        <li>Add the action to a Screen Set by configuring the <a href="../content_manager/configure_results_page_actions.htm">Actions menu</a> in the <a href="../content_manager/identification.htm">Screen Set Manager</a>.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Remember, only screen sets that are configured with a Query ID that matches the business object in the Action Definition ID can be configured with the user-defined action. In the example above, only screen sets with a Query ID of OB_ORDER_BASE can be used. Also, remember the name of the user-defined action must match the text defined for the Label ID that you used to create the action.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="agent" id="agent"></a>Configure Agents as Actions</h2>
      <p>Follow these steps to configure an automation agent as a manual action that can be run from the Results pages of various business objects. After you create a user-defined action, you need to edit or create an appropriate screen set and configure that screen set to display the user-defined action on the Actions menu.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Name the new action in the <span class="Bold">Action</span> field. The action name will appear on the Actions tab of a screen set when you include the action on the screen set.</li>
        <li>Select a <span class="Bold"><a href="../translation_manager/new_translation_id.htm">Label</a></span> to define the text that appears on the action menu for the action. This label text also appears on the Actions list in the Screen Set Manager (Actions tab).
          <br>
          <br>
          For example, if you create an action with a Label ID that has text defined as MY ORDER AGENT, the Actions menu displays the action menu option as MY ORDER AGENT. </li>
        <li>Select an <span class="Bold">Action Definition ID</span> to configure agent actions.
          <br>
          <br>
          The Action Definition ID determines the screen sets to which you can add the action. For example, if you select RUN_AGENT_ORDER_BASE, only screen sets assigned to an Order Base Query ID (OB_ORDER_BASE) will display the action as a valid choice on the Actions tab in the Screen Set Manager. The Action Definition ID also determines the automation agents that appear in the Agent ID list (see step 5). For example, if you select RUN_AGENT_ORDER_BASE, only agents with an Agent Type of ORDER BASE appear in the Agent ID list. </li>
        <li>Select a <span class="Bold">Domain Name</span> in which to store the new action (or leave the default which is the current domain).</li>
        <li>Select an agent from the <span class="Bold">Agent ID</span> list.</li>
        <li>Select <span class="Bold">Results Message Text</span>. For example, you can define the message text that appears on the action results screen.</li>
        <li>Enter a value in seconds in the <span class="Bold">Auto Close Result Message Timer (seconds)</span> field. This is a timer after which the action results screen with the above results message will auto close.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="Bold">Finished</span> to save the new action.</li>
        <li>Run the <span class="Bold"><a href="../user_management/actions/manage_action_security.htm">Secure Action</a></span> action against the newly-created action.</li>
        <li>Add the action to a screen set by configuring the <a href="../content_manager/configure_results_page_actions.htm">Actions menu</a> in the <a href="../content_manager/identification.htm">Screen Set Manager</a>.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Remember, only screen sets that are configured with a Query ID that matches the business object in the Action Definition ID can be configured with the user-defined action. In the example above, only screen sets with a Query ID of OB_ORDER_BASE can be used. Also, remember the name of the user-defined action must match the text defined for the Label ID that you used to create the action.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="external" id="external"></a>Create Action for External URL</h2>
      <p>Follow these steps to create an action that sends an Order Base ID to an external URL.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Name the new action in the <span class="Bold">Action</span> field. The action name will appear on the Actions tab of a screen set when you include the action on the screen set.</li>
        <li>Select a <span class="Bold"><a href="../translation_manager/new_translation_id.htm">Label</a></span> that defines that text that appears on the action menu for the action. This Label text also appears on the Actions list in the Screen Set Manager (Actions tab).
          <br>
          <br>
          For example, if you create an action with a Label ID that has text defined as SEND ORDER TO EXTERNAL WEBSITE, the Actions menu displays the action menu option as SEND ORDER TO EXTERNAL WEBSITE. </li>
        <li>Select an <span class="Bold">Action Definition ID</span> to configure an action, such as REDIRECT_ORDER_BASE, to send parameters to an external URL.</li>
        <li>Select a <span class="Bold">Domain Name</span> in which to store the new action (or leave the default which is the current domain).</li>
        <li>Enter the <span class="Bold">URL</span> for the website that will receive the order data; for example, https://www.example.com.</li>
        <li>Enter a Parameter Name in the <span class="Bold">Parameter Name</span> field for the Order Base ID. The Parameter Name is site specific and can be anything that you want it to be. For example, if you are redirecting an Order Base ID to http://.example.com and you want the ID to be named &quot;value&quot;, enter the word value in the Parameter Name field. When Oracle Transportation Management redirects to the external site, it sends http:/example.com/value=CORP.ORDER123. If you leave Parameter Name blank, Oracle Transportation Management redirects with http://example.com/pk=CORP.ORDER123</li>
        <li>Select a <span class="Bold">Parameter Value</span>. You may select to send either the GID or XID with the action.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="Bold">Finished</span> to save the new action.</li>
        <li>Run the <span class="Bold"><a href="../user_management/actions/manage_action_security.htm">Secure Action</a></span> action against the newly-created action.</li>
        <li>Add the action to a screen set by configuring the <a href="../content_manager/configure_results_page_actions.htm">Actions menu</a> in the <a href="../content_manager/identification.htm">Screen Set Manager</a>.
          <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: Remember, only screen sets that are configured with a Query ID that matches the business object in the Action Definition ID can be configured with the user-defined action. In the example above, only screen sets with a Query ID of OB_ORDER_BASE can be used. Also, remember the name of the user-defined action must match the text defined for the Label ID that you used to create the action.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="document" id="document"></a>Configure Documents as Actions</h2>
      <p>Follow these steps to configure a document as a manual action. After you create a user-defined action, you need to edit or create an appropriate screen set and configure that screen set to display the user-defined action on the Actions menu.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Name the new action in the <span class="Bold">Action</span> field. The action name will appear on the Actions tab of a screen set when you include the action on the screen set.</li>
        <li>Select a <span class="Bold"><a href="../translation_manager/new_translation_id.htm">Label</a></span> to define the text that appears on the action menu for the action. This Label text also appears on the Actions list in the Screen Set Manager (Actions tab).
          <br>
          <br>
          For example, if you create an action with a Label ID that has text defined as MY DOCUMENT, the Actions menu displays the action menu option as MY DOCUMENT. </li>
        <li>Select an <span class="Bold">Action Definition ID</span> such as RUN_DOCUMENT_SHIPMENT to configure document actions. Your selection of an Action Definition ID determines the Screen Sets to which you can add the action.</li>
        <li>Select a <span class="Bold">Domain Name</span> in which to store the new action (or leave the default which is the current domain).</li>
        <li>If you select the <span class="Bold">Preview</span> field, the generated document will be marked as a preview and will not be saved when viewing the document in the document manager.</li>
        <li>Perform a search in the <span class="Bold"><a href="../planning/power_data/reports/document_type.htm">Document Type</a></span> field and select a document type from the list. The document type you select should correspond with the Agent Definition ID that you selected.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="Bold">Finished</span> to save the new action.</li>
        <li>Run the <span class="Bold"><a href="../user_management/actions/manage_action_security.htm">Secure Action</a></span> action against the newly-created action.</li>
        <li>Add the action to a screen set by configuring the <a href="../content_manager/configure_results_page_actions.htm">Actions menu</a> in the <a href="../content_manager/identification.htm">Screen Set Manager</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2><a name="action" id="action"></a>Configure Action Attributes</h2>
      <p>Many planning actions honor various constraints as part of the standard shipment planning logic. However, you can configure the following planning actions to display an Ignore Constraints page when these actions are run. From the Ignore Constraints page, you can turn off the various constraints that appear. For example, you could configure the Create Buy Shipment - Direct action to ignore any order constraints such as <a href="../field_definitions/date_emphasis.htm">Date Emphasis</a>, Equipment, Itinerary, or Rate assignments, etc.</p>
