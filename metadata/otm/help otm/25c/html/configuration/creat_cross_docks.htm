    <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">How to Configure Cross-Docks and Pools</span></h1>
    <div role="main">
      <p>This help topic describes how to set up the locations, service providers, contacts, rates, and itineraries that determine how cross-docks and pools operate at your organization. Use cross-docks and pools to model distribution activity your organization may use to achieve lower shipping cost.</p>
      <p>Cross-docks function as distribution centers. Orders arrive at the cross-dock, are removed from their current shipment, and re-planned with other orders for further distribution on new shipments. Pools act as de-consolidation centers for orders with destination locations in the region associated with the pool. Shipments are created accordingly.</p>
      <p>During planning, Oracle Transportation Management determines whether a shipment uses a cross-dock or pool based on the itinerary assigned to the shipment. Oracle Transportation Management compares information on the orders on a shipment to rules established on the itinerary that state when shipments go to distribution centers.</p>
      <p>At a cross-dock or pool location, orders are moved from the shipment in which they arrived to another shipment from which they exit the location by handling shipments. Handling shipments are created by Oracle Transportation Management during shipment planning to determine the cost associated with moving freight through a cross-dock or pool. The handling shipment relates to the service provider you assign to the pool (there is no tender process for handling shipments), and Oracle Transportation Management uses the handling rate offering and rate record for that service provider to determine the cost of the handling shipment. (Handling shipments are optional).</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: You can only have one cross-dock per itinerary.</p>
      <h2><a name="Setup" id="Setup"></a>Set Up Cross-Docks and Distribution Pools</h2>
      <p>You must define values in several business objects when creating a cross-dock or a pool. The following sections define data entry for each business object required to complete this setup. For complete help instructions about a business object, read the online help specific to that business object.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: You can also import the necessary data through integration. See the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=otm-latest&amp;id=OTMIT" target="_blank" title="Integration Guide">Integration Guide</a> on the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=otm-latest&amp;id=otm-gs" target="_blank">Oracle Help Center</a>.</p>
      <p>Cross-dock and pool setup includes the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Set up the cross-dock or pool location. This represents the geographic place where the cross-dock or pool resides.</li>
        <li>Create a service provider for the cross-dock or pool. The service provider represents the organization who receives payment for activity at the cross-dock or pool.</li>
        <li>Create a contact for the service provider. The contact is the individual who is notified about cross-dock activity.</li>
        <li>Create a rate offering and a rate record for the service provider to establish the cost for cross-dock and pool activity.</li>
        <li>Create an itinerary that describes the geographic and routing requirements for orders using the cross-dock or pool.</li>
        <li>For a pool you must define the region serviced by the pool. Define <a href="../planning/power_data/geography/regions.htm">regions</a> in Power Data. Shipments with delivery locations in the region you define are candidates for using the pool.</li>
        <li>In Shipment Management &gt; Shipment Management &gt; Power Data &gt; General &gt; <a href="../planning/power_data/planning/list_of_planning_parameters.htm">Parameter Sets</a>, define appropriate parameters that impact which orders are sent to cross-docks and pools during the planning process.</li>
        <li>In Shipment Management &gt; Shipment Management &gt; Power Data &gt; General &gt; <a href="../planning/power_data/planning/logic_configuration.htm">Location Configuration</a>, define appropriate logic configuration parameters that impact which orders are sent to cross-docks and pools during the planning process.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3><a name="Location" id="Location"></a>Location Manager</h3>
      <p>Define the geographic location of the cross-dock or pool.</p>
      <p>The following table describes the pages and fields in the Location Manager where you must enter particular values to create a cross-dock or pool location. For a complete description of location setup, refer to the <a href="../planning/location_manager/location_identification.htm">Location Manager</a> help topic.</p>

              <p>Enter XDOCK for a cross-dock. See <a href="../planning/location_manager/location_roles.htm#Additional_Constraints">XDock</a> for more information about using this location role.</p>
              <p>Enter CONSOLIDATION_POOL or DECONSOLIDATION_POOL for a pool. See <a href="../planning/location_manager/location_roles.htm#Additional_Constraints">Consolidation and Deconsolidation Pools</a> for more information about using this location role.</p>

      <h3><a name="Service" id="Service"></a>Service Provider</h3>
      <p>Define the <a href="../planning/location_manager/create_sp.htm">service provider</a> responsible for activity at the location you defined. The service provider receives payment for invoices created as the result of handling shipments at the cross-dock or pool.</p>
      <h3><a name="Contact" id="Contact"></a>Contact</h3>
      <p>A <a href="../communication/contact_manager/create_new_contact.htm">contact</a> is the individual who receives and sends messages regarding activity at the cross-dock or pool. In addition, the contact may appear on bills and invoices.</p>
      <p>When defining a contact, it is often useful to associate a <a href="../planning/power_data/calendars/create_new_cal.htm">calendar</a> with the contact to establish office hours during which the contact person is available.</p>
      <h3><a name="Rate" id="Rate"></a>Rate Offering</h3>
      <p>A rate offering is a general contract with a service provider. You need to define a rate offering for the handling shipments to determine the cost for using the cross-dock or pool. In addition, you may define a rate offering from a pool location to the destination locations to differentiate those rates from other rates you use such as LTL.</p>
      <p>The following table describes the pages and fields under <a href="../planning/rate_manager/create_rate_offering.htm">rate offering</a> in the Rate Manager where you must enter particular values to create a cross-dock or pool rate offering.</p>

        </tbody>
      </table>
      <h3>Rate Record</h3>
      <p>Rate Records are created based on a rate offering. While the rate offering provides general contract details from a service provider, a rate record provides specific costing or rating data from one place to another. The record inherits much of its data from the offering but the options selected in the offering can be overridden at the record level.</p>
      <p>When creating a rate record, first select the rate offering on which the record is to be based.</p>
      <p>The following table describes the Oracle Transportation Management pages and fields under <a href="../planning/rate_manager/create_rate_record.htm">rate record</a> in the Rate Manager where you must enter particular values to create a cross-dock or pool rate record.</p>
      <table title="Table describing the pages and fields under rate record in the Rate Manager">

      <p>Typically, the <a href="../planning/rate_manager/rate_costs.htm">rate cost</a> for handling shipments are based on 100 weight calculation.</p>
      <h3><a name="Itinerary" id="Itinerary"></a>Itinerary</h3>
      <p>Itineraries determine the routing for shipments. You must define itineraries that determine which shipments go to the cross-dock or pool. Also, you must define itineraries to carry the shipments that travel directly to their destination location when they do not meet the requirements for using a cross-dock or pool. For example, orders below a certain size may be carried by a parcel carrier, while those above a particular size such as truckloads may travel direct.</p>
      <p>The following table describes the pages and fields in the <a href="../planning/itinerary_manager/itinerary_parameters.htm">Itinerary Manager</a> where you must enter particular <a href="../planning/itinerary_manager/itinerary_parameters.htm#cross_dock">values to create a cross-dock or pool itinerary</a>.</p>
