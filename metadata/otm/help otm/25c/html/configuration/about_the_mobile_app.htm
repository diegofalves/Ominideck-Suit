  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">About the Mobile Application</span></h1>
  <div role="main">
    <p><a id="app_about_mobile_application"></a>The Oracle Transportation Mobile Web Application is a mobile browser-based application that lets carriers and drivers to do basic functions. It can provide an offline user experience and be configured and customized via a <a href="../user_configuration/mobile_layout.htm">mobile layout</a> and user preference that selects that customized mobile layout. The Mobile Web Application shows same language as the mobile device and uses all of OTM&#39;s <a href="../user_preferences/setting_user_preferences.htm#Language">supported languages</a>.</p>
    <p>The mobile app can be added to the home screen of your mobile device.Â After setting up the mobile app, use the browser in your mobile device to Add to Home Screen after you haveÂ opened the mobile web app in the browser. Each OS has a different method for adding a web page to their home screen, but the option usually exists from the browser&#39;s Share feature. That will create an icon on the mobile device which will open the mobile web app directly.</p>
    <h2>User Role Functionality</h2>
    <p>Based on the role of the user, different functionality is available.</p>
    <h3><a id="driver_user"></a>Driver User</h3>
    <p>When a driver logs into the mobile web application, they are presented with their shipments on the springboard, organized primarily by status. To create a customized interface for a driver user, make a copy of the <a href="../user_configuration/mobile_layout.htm#servprov">SERVPROV</a> mobile layout, and then edit the copy. The driver can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>View Assigned Shipments</li>
      <li>Confirm Assigned Shipments</li>
      <li>View Confirmed Shipments</li>
      <li>Start the next Confirmed Shipment to make it their Current/Active Shipment</li>
      <li>Record Events for the Active Shipment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A driver will have only one Active shipment at a time.</p>
    <h3><a id="carrier_user"></a>Carrier User</h3>
    <p>When a carrier logs into the mobile web application, they are presented with their shipments on the springboard, organized primarily by status. To create a customized interface for a carrier user, make a copy of the <a href="../user_configuration/mobile_layout.htm#default">DEFAULT</a> mobile layout, and then edit the copy. The carrier can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accept or Reject Normal tender</li>
      <li>Start Accepted Shipment</li>
      <li>Record Events for the Active Shipments</li>
      <li>Respond to Spot bid</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Ordinary Tender</h4>
    <p>A carrier can access a normal tender and choose to respond (Accept or Reject). Upon Accepting, the carrier needs to start the shipment by tapping the start button, which moves shipment to the Active Shipment box where they can enter shipment events. The carrier can also enter more information (updated pickup date and time, equipment information, etc.) after accepting the tender from the Accepted Shipment box by tapping &quot;Update&quot;.Â </p>
    <p>If the carrier declines a tender, the shipment will move to the All Shipments box. The carrier can also enter a Decline reason code while declining the tender, if that is enabled.</p>
    <p>A carrier can have more than one active shipments. The carrier can accept or decline tenders, and &quot;start&quot; shipment while the device is offline, if this functionality is enabled.</p>
    <h4>Spot Bid</h4>
    <p>A carrier can respond to a bid by entering the amount, and then submitting the bid. The carrier may submit multiple bids until the bid is âWithdrawnâ or âAwardedâ. An awarded bid can be viewed in normal tender options. They may decline a spot bid at any point of the spot bid process.Â </p>
    <h4>Broadcast Tender</h4>
    <p>A carrier can respond to broadcast tender by entering the bid amount and submitting it. Depending on the bid value, a carrier may get tender auto assigned, or you may choose to wait for a more favorable bid.Â  In that case the carrier may enter subsequent bids. The carrier also has an option to decline the broadcast tender.</p>
    <h4>Invoice</h4>
    <p>A carrier can view auto-generated invoices, add/modify the cost, and then submit the invoice for approval. You can also upload documents to support line items. To use this, you must edit your mobile layout and setÂ theÂ hideOnDashboard to &quot;false&quot; for the invoices dynamic box.</p>
    <h2>Common Processes and Features</h2>
    <h3>Entering Shipment Events</h3>
    <p>Once you have Active Shipment/s, you can open it to view the stops. Stop level actions are available and change as they proceed with the shipment. For example, if it is a 2 stop shipment, the following is the basic sequence of events the user will complete:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stop 1 - Arrived</li>
      <li>Stop 1 - Departed</li>
      <li>Stop 2 - Arrived</li>
      <li>Stop 2 - Departed (this completes the shipment)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Aside from the basic flow described above, you can record any other event at a stop or on the shipment. Additionally, you may add photos/PDF documents and/or a signature.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>:Â Although not specific to the mobile web application, in order for an event/tracking event to get processed in OTM, a matching agent along with a corresponding workflow agent is needed. It can be â<a href="../agent_manager/agent_actions_by_object/tracking_event_agent_actions.htm#leg_ship_match">Legacy Shipment Matching</a>â along with the public agent â<a href="../agent_manager/shipment_public_automation_agents.htm#ship_event_tracker">Shipment Event Tracker</a>â or the â<a href="../agent_manager/agent_actions_by_object/tracking_event_agent_actions.htm#match_shipment">Match Shipment</a>â agent action, and a tracking event based agent for workflow processing.</p>
    <h3>Offline Indicator <span class="oj-ux-ico-domain-offline"></span></h3>
    <p>You can enter events even when the device is offline. The mobile web applications has an Offline icon<span class="oj-ux-ico-domain-offline"></span> that indicates when the device is not connected to internet. Events will be synchronized when the device is connected to internet. You can also see the status of events synchronization under the Offline Messages menu.</p>
    <p>When an event is submitted offline, a red dot appears on the Offline Messages menu item.</p>
    <h3>Shipment Search</h3>
    <p>You can search for shipments with any of the fields which are available in the mobile web app, e.g., shipment ID, location, city etc.. When you enter the numbers or characters in the search criteria, a result count appears on the different tabs; and you can find the matching shipments on the tabs.</p>
    <p>The up/down arrow button next to the Search field allows you to change the sort order of the records returned. Tapping the button lets you choose between an ascending and descending sort order, as well as what you want to sort on, such as the date or shipment ID.</p>
    <h3>Favorite Shipments</h3>
    <p>If you would like a shipment to appear at the top of your query results, swipe left on the shipment to mark it as a Favorite. You can remove the setting by swiping left toÂ Unfavorite. Shipments marked as a favorite have a gold star<icon class="oj-ux-ico-star-s favorite-image"></icon> to indicate that setting. If you are viewing a shipment detail, you can mark a shipment as a favorite by tapping the star icon.</p>
    <h3>Ship Unit Received Quantity and Remarks (Optional)</h3>
    <p>You can optionally enter a shipment ship unit received quantity and remark while entering shipment events. If the barcode scanner is enabled in the mobile layout, you can scan barcodes on the ship unit (pallet/box/drum, etc.). The barcode will be matched to either the shipment ship unit ID or a reference number value on the shipment ship unit. You may enable theÂ shipUnitAutofill setting in your mobile layoutÂ to auto-populate ship unit quantity. In this case, the planned ship unit quantity information is captured as actual. If you want to modify it, you can tap the Ship Unit link and update the quantity manually.</p>
    <h3>View Contacts and Documents (Optional)</h3>
    <p>You can view contact information and documents which is available on the shipment. Contact information can be used to approach the contact. Documents and images can be viewed within the app, or downloaded to your device, if required.</p>
    <h3>Print Button</h3>
    <p>If your device is configured to send content to a printer, you can use the Print button to print images, signatures, and PDFs from a document popup. Note that if you are using an Android, the PDF will first open automatically in the native PDF viewer where you can then print.</p>
    <h3>Refresh Button</h3>
    <span class="oj-ux-ico-refresh"></span>
    <p>The Refresh icon is at the top of the screen, next to the Home icon<span class="oj-ux-ico-home"></span>. If the setting is enabled, not all boxes will get reloaded by tapping on the Home icon. If you want to reload all of the boxes, tap the Refresh icon.</p>
    <h3>Location Map in Native App</h3>
    <p>You can open the location map in you deviceâs native map application (google maps, apple maps etc.) by tapping on &quot;Open in Maps&quot;.</p>
    <h3>Showing User Information</h3>
    <span class="oj-ux-ico-contact"></span>
    <p>You can see information about your user ID and role by tapping the user information icon. This icon is available from all windows.</p>
    <h3>Appointments</h3>
    <p>When you click on the Appointment icon you will be taken to the Manage Appointments page where you can add or edit an appointment. The Get Appointments button retrieves the available appointments for a stop. You must click the Refresh icon to have your edits displayed elsewhere in the app. To enable this box, you must edit your mobile layout and setÂ theÂ hideOnDashboard to &quot;false&quot; for the dock appointments dynamic box.</p>
    <h2>Configuring the Mobile Web Application</h2>
    <h3>Enable Access</h3>
    <p>In order to use the Oracle Transportation Mobile Web App, the intended mobile web app user must have a <a href="../user_management/user_role.htm">user role</a> with access the following <a href="../user_management/access_control_list.htm">access control lists</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span><span class="Bold">Mobile Web Application REST - View</span>:Â  If you want the user to have read-only access to the mobile app. All mobile web app uses should have this setting.</span></li>
      <li><span><span class="Bold">Mobile Web Application REST - Update</span>: If you the user to Start/Confirm Shipments or Add Event, you will need this access as well as the View access.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Saved Query Access</h3>
    <p>If you&#39;ve restricted user access to specific saved queries, you must provide access to the following saved queries. Additionally, if your mobile layout references a custom saved query, you must grant access to that as well. SeeÂ <a href="../user_access/general_access.htm">Configure User Access</a>Â for details.</p>
    <p>By default a Servprov user needs access to these Saved Queries to run the mobile app:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>SERVPROVS ACCEPTED SHIPMENTS</li>
      <li>SERVPROVS ACTIVE SHIPMENTS</li>
      <li>SERVPROVS ALL SHIPMENTS</li>
      <li>SERVPROVS COMPLETED SHIPMENTS</li>
      <li>SERVPROVS OPENSPOTBID SHIPMENTS</li>
      <li>SERVPROVS SUBMITTEDSPOTBID SHIPMENTS</li>
      <li>SERVPROVS TENDERED SHIPMENTS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By default a Driver user needs access to these Saved Queries to run the mobile app:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>DRIVERS ALL FUTURE SHIPMENTS</li>
      <li>DRIVERS ASSIGNED SHIPMENTS</li>
      <li>DRIVERS COMPLETED SHIPMENTS</li>
      <li>DRIVERS CONFIRMED SHIPMENTS</li>
      <li>DRIVERS CURRENT SHIPMENT</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Custom Saved Queries</h3>
    <p>You can write you own saved query and replace the PUBLIC one in the <a href="../user_configuration/mobile_layout.htm">mobile layout</a> with your custom query. You must define the saved query GID in the <span class="Bold">savedQueryGid</span>Â element in then the mobile layout in order to use it.</p>
    <h3>Opt In</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Opt in to the <a href="../user_management/optional_features.htm">Optional Feature</a>, &quot;SUPPORT REST SEQUIPMENT REFERENCE.&quot;</li>
      <li>OptÂ in to the <a href="../user_management/optional_features.htm">Optional Feature</a>, &quot;USE FILE REPOSITORY FOR REST.&quot;</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Create VPD to Limit Invoice Access</h3>
    <p>If you are giving your SERVPROV users access to invoice <a href="../user_management/access_control_list.htm">ACLs</a>, then you should also add an Invoice <a href="../user_management/vpd_profile.htm">VPD</a> to your SERVPROV VPD. Use the following text for your VPD definition:</p>
    <p><span class="Code">exists (select &#39;x&#39; from user_association where user_association.gl_user_gid = vpd.get_gl_user() AND user_association.user_association_qual = &#39;SERVPROV&#39; and invoice.servprov_gid = user_association.user_association_value)</span></p>
    <h3>Properties</h3>
    <p>Add the following to properties set to avoid saved query delays:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../properties/glog/fusion.properties.htm#glog.fusion.cil.restapi.config.disableDefaultChildRefResourceExpansion">glog.fusion.cil.restapi.config.disableDefaultChildRefResourceExpansion</a>=true</li>
      <li><a href="../properties/glog/fusion.properties.htm#glog.fusion.cil.restapi.config.expandChildRefResources">glog.fusion.cil.restapi.config.expandChildRefResources</a>=false</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Create a Custom Mobile Layout</h3>
    <p>If you do not want to use the default <a href="../user_configuration/mobile_layout.htm">mobile layout</a>, copy and customize it to suit your needs. Â </p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Select the Mobile Layout to Use</h3>
    <p>Edit theÂ <a href="../user_preferences/setting_user_preferences.htm">User Preferences</a>Â for the user. Add theÂ Mobile Layout ID user preference, and select the Mobile Layout of your choosing.</p>
    <h3>Launching the Mobile Web Application</h3>
    <p>The URL for the mobile web app is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>https://[hostname]/logisticsmobile</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Where the [hostname] is your OTM URL.</p>
    <p>Supported browsers are the most recent versions of Safari for iOS and Chrome for Android. Â </p>
    <h3>Add the Mobile Web Application to a Mobile Device</h3>
    <p>See above for adding a shortcut to the app to your mobile device&#39;s home screen.</p>
