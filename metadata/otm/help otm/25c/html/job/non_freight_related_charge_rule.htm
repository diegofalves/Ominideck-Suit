    <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Non-Freight Related Charge Rule</span></h1>
    <div role="main">
      <p>Non-Freight-Related Charge (NFRC) Rules can be configured to automatically assign Non-Freight Related Charges (NFRCs) to a job or quote. The NFRC Rules page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Brokerage and Forwarding &gt; Job Management &gt; Non Freight Related Charge Rules.</span></p>
      <p>NFRC rules are based on various order release, quote and shipment attributes that are attached to the job or specific criteria on the job itself. When Oracle Transportation Management determines that a charge applies to a given job based on the defined criteria, NFRCs are created and assigned to a job. You can view the resulting NFRCs on the Job Details page.</p>
      <p>When Oracle Transportation Management determines that a charge applies to a given quote based on the defined criteria, NFRCs are created and assigned to a quote. You can view the resulting NFRCs on the <a href="../planning/order_manager/quote/quote_identification.htm">Quote manager</a> on the <a href="../planning/order_manager/quote/quote_cost_options.htm">Cost Options tab</a>. If added for a quote, sell side NFRCs only apply to sell side but buy side NFRCs apply to both the buy and sell side.</p>
      <p>Oracle Transportation Management assigns NFRCs as a result of running the <a href="actions/apply_charge_rule.htm">Apply NFRC Rules</a> action from the Job Details page or via a job automation agent that is configured with the Charge-Non Freight Related action.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: The start and end times of the generated NFRCs are set to the start time of the primary leg (buy/sell)shipment.</p>
      <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: You can also manually create NFRCs for a job on the <a href="job_workspace.htm#non">Job Detail</a> page.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Charge Rule ID</span> uniquely identifies the rule. This field is not controlled by the Business Number Generator so you must enter a value to successfully add a new rule.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Charge Rule Type</span> determines the fields that appear as matching criteria (job, order, buy shipment, sell shipment, quote or all) upon which to assign NFRCs as well as data that can be populated on the resulting NFRCs. For example, you can configure a rule to create NFRCs based on order data only, shipment data only, or job attributes. Select ALL to display all of the choices. Note that quotes consider all charge rule types. Selecting Quote restricts the rule so it is only applicable to quotes. Quote charge rules do not display move perspective, job type, or order release type.</li>
        <li>In the <span class="Bold">Perspective</span> field, specify whether the rule should generate a buy charge, sell charge, or both. These charges appear in the Expense and Revenue sections of the Job Detail page depending on your choice in this field.</li>
        <li>Select the <span class="Bold">Calculate Cost</span> checkbox if you want Oracle Transportation Management to calculate an amount on the resulting NFRCs based on the Rate Record that you can specify in the (Buy/Sell) Charge Information of the page. If you select this checkbox, specify a Rate Record to calculate the amount of the NFRC.</li>
        <li><a name="accessorial" id="accessorial"></a>You must assign an <span class="Bold">Accessorial Code</span> to the rule as means of identifying a description of the charge. This does not control the amount that is calculated for the charge but it is used to populate the Description field that appears for the charge on the Job Details page for each NFRC with the description of the <a href="../planning/power_data/rates_and_codes/accessorial_codes.htm">Accessorial Code</a>.</li>
        <li>The <span class="Bold">Profit Split</span> checkbox indicates the NFRC shipments created from this NFRC Rule are profit split shipments.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The <span class="Bold">Criteria</span> sections allow you to configure matching attributes that Oracle Transportation Management will evaluate before it creates NFRCs. In general, Oracle Transportation Management creates charges when at least one match is found after comparing data against multiple objects such as orders or shipments.</p>
      <p>The <span class="Bold">Charge</span> sections allow you to specify data attributes that are assigned to the resulting NFRCs.</p>
      <h2><a name="Job" id="Job"></a>Job Criteria</h2>
      <p>Use the following fields to establish matching criteria based on job attributes. Oracle Transportation Management compares the field values defined on the rule with those entered on the Create/Edit Job page to determine whether to create NFRC charges.</p>
