  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Job Details</span></h1>
  <div role="main">
    <p>The <span class="Bold">Job</span> page is accessed via <span class="Bold">Brokerage and Forwarding &gt; Job Management &gt; Job Details</span>. Choose a <span class="Bold">Job ID</span> and click <span class="Bold">Go/Refresh</span>.</p>
    <p>A job facilitates the Buy and Sell perspective so that you can easily visualize cost/revenue and therefore the profit margin on providing transportation services to a customer.</p>
    <p>This page is very configurable.</p>
    <p>The purpose of the job is to provide one business object that brings together the objects and activities required by logistics service providers. Below lists the primary functions the job provides:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The ability to group buy shipments, sell shipments, non-freight related charges, and customer bills related to a job and perform existing functions/actions against those objects.</li>
      <li>International forwarders the ability to manage jobs from various perspectives depending on responsibility; for example, Export Only, Import Only, Import and Export, Consolidations, etc.</li>
      <li>The ability to manage settlement functions at the job level.
        <ul>
          <li>View job profitability which includes all expenses and revenues related to the job.</li>
          <li>Perform billing functions.</li>
          <li>Manage non-freight related charges (both buy and sell).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>A single outbound interface for a job.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Job Detail page provides the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Consol ID if the job has a consol.</li>
      <li>Order Releases that are assigned to the job with summary information such as object ID, locations, dates, weight/volume, and remarks.</li>
      <li>Customer Bills</li>
      <li>Revenue (including non freight-related charges) based on the bills that have been generated for the order.</li>
      <li>Expenses incurred from the Buy shipments that have been created for the order.</li>
      <li>Profit/loss based on the difference between the revenue and expenses.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: As you work on this page, remember to click <span class="Bold">Go/Refresh</span> after performing actions or editing records.</p>
    <p>By default, each section of the page is blank until you assign order releases to the job.</p>
    <p>For each object that appears in the sections below, you can perform various SmartLinks and Actions that are available for that business object as well as click its ID to edit the object.</p>
    <p>Click <a href="job_workspace_actions.htm">Actions</a> on the Job Details page to perform specific actions for the job such as Add or Remove Order, Generate Customer Bill, etc.</p>
    <p>You can also configure the appearance of some of the data columns and sections on this page.</p>
    <h2><a name="or" id="or"></a>Order Releases</h2>
    <p>This section of the page lists the order releases or order movements (depending on your configuration choice when the job was created) that are assigned to the job. Summary order information appears for each order in the list.</p>
    <p>The property <a href="../properties/glog/job.property.htm#financial.order.INVPARTY">glog.job.financial.order.INVPARTY</a> controls if the involved party displays in this section.</p>
    <p>Level 1 <a href="../general/remarks.htm">Remarks</a> also appear beneath each order release if the job is configured to show order releases.</p>
    <p>If an order has related buy/sell shipments they automatically appear in the Expense/Revenue sections of this page, respectively.</p>
    <h3>Add/Remove Orders</h3>
    <p>Use the appropriate Job actions to assign/remove orders.</p>
    <h2><a name="bill" id="bill"></a>Customer Bills</h2>
    <p>Oracle Transportation Management supports customer billing at the shipment, consolidation, and job level.</p>
    <p>The property <a href="../properties/glog/job.property.htm#financial.custbill">glog.job.financial.custbill</a> determines whether the Customer Bills section appears.</p>
    <p>The primary billing functions provided at the job level are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create multiple bills for a job based on the sell shipments and non-freight related charges that are assigned to the job. To create a customer bill for a job, you must use the Generate Bill action at the top of the Job Details page.</li>
      <li>Track incremental adjustments at the line level where the original bill is related to multiple sell shipments. Use the <a href="../planning/shipment_manager/bill_adjusted_costs.htm">Bill Adjusted Costs</a> action anytime you change or add sell shipments or non-freight related charges to create additional bills that reflect the changes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also remove a bill using the <a href="actions/delete_bill.htm">Delete Bill</a> action at the top of the page.</p>
    <p>After the bill is created it will appear in this section (after a refresh). The Total Amount Billed is the sum of all customer bills related to the job.</p>
    <h2><a name="revenue" id="revenue"></a>Revenue</h2>
    <p>The Revenue section is divided into freight and non-freight sections. The following properties allow you to hide or display specific information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../properties/glog/job.property.htm#financial.sell.show_servprov">glog.job.financial.sell.show_servprov</a> enables you to show or hide the service provider field in the Revenue section.</li>
      <li><a href="../properties/glog/job.property.htm#financial.sell.show_transportmode">glog.job.financial.sell.show_transportmode</a> enables you to show or hide the transport mode field in the Revenue section</li>
      <li><a href="../properties/glog/job.property.htm#sell.ADVANCED">glog.job.sell.ADVANCED</a> If true, displays the Advanced Charges column in this section</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Freight-Related Revenue</h3>
    <p>The first section shows the freight charges that result from the sell shipments that were created from one or more of the order releases that are assigned to the job. Several columns of summary shipment data appear including the shipment ID, shipment start and end date/time, source/destination location, service provider, transportation mode, and shipment cost. The following additional fields can appear if you configure the appropriate properties:</p>
    <table title="freight related revenue Table">

          <td>
            <p>Displays the General Ledger Code assigned to each shipment cost record if the same code applies for each cost record. If there are multiple cost records with different general ledger codes, the word MIXED appears.</p>
            <p>You can manually assign a general ledger code to shipment cost records using the Shipment Manager Financials tab or they can be assigned using the <a href="../planning/order_manager/order_rel_actions/assign_general_ledger.htm">Assign General Ledger Codes</a> action.</p>
            <p>For <a href="non_freight_related_charge.htm">NFRCs</a>, general ledger codes can also be entered manually or assigned via an <a href="non_freight_related_charge_rule.htm">NFRC Rule</a>.</p>

            <p>For NFRCs, payment method codes can also be entered manually or assigned via a NFRC Rule.</p>

      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Secondary Charges</h3>
    <p>If a shipment has secondary charges, they appear indented beneath each shipment to which the secondary charges belong.</p>
    <h3><a name="non" id="non"></a>Non-Freight Related Revenue</h3>
    <p>By default, this section is blank until you record non-freight related charges that typically represent fees that are not necessarily associated with the actual transportation charges. Click New to create a new charge. The new button only appears if the <a href="../properties/glog/job.property.htm#newNFRC">glog.job.newNFRC</a> property is configured to show it.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span>: You can also create NFRC rules that automate the creation of non-freight related charges.</p>
    <h3>Total Job Revenue</h3>
    <p>The Total Job Revenue is the total of all freight and non-freight related charges. This value determines the profit of the job (see below).</p>
    <h2><a name="expense" id="expense"></a>Expenses</h2>
    <p>The Expenses section is also divided into freight and non-freight sections.</p>
    <p>The property <a href="../properties/glog/job.property.htm#financial.amount">glog.job.financial.amount</a> determines whether the Allocation Amount, Total Amount, or both amounts appear in the Expense section.</p>
    <p>The property <a href="../properties/glog/job.property.htm#financial.buy.show_servprov">glog.job.financial.buy.show_servprov</a> enables you to show or hide the service provider field in this section.</p>
    <p>The property <a href="../properties/glog/job.property.htm#financial.buy.show_transportmode">glog.job.financial.buy.show_transportmode</a> enables you to show or hide the transport mode field in the expenses section.</p>
    <h3>Freight-Related Expenses</h3>
    <p>The first section shows the freight charges that result from the buy shipments that were created from one or more of the order releases that are assigned to the job.</p>
    <p><a href="../execution/shipment_groups/secondary_charge.htm">Secondary charges</a> also appear beneath each buy shipment, if applicable.</p>
    <p>Columns of summary shipment data, similar to the sell shipments above, appear for each buy shipment.</p>
    <p>The <a href="../settlement/allocation_rule_manager/alloc_rule_mgr_overview.htm">Alloc Amt</a>/Total Amt column displays the allocated cost vs the total cost of the buy shipment. The Alloc Amt column is populated after you successfully allocate the cost of a shipment.</p>
    <p>The Amt fields determine the profit on a job as described in the Profit section below.</p>
    <p>You can display Total Weight and Volume as well as the level of location detail shown by configuring a <a href="../properties/glog/job.property.htm">Job</a> property.</p>
    <p>You can also control whether to display both Alloc Amt and Total Amt fields or just one or the other. These display options determine how the Total Job Cost is calculated.</p>
    <h3><a name="non1" id="non1"></a>Non-Freight Related Expenses</h3>
    <p>You can record charges of this type from an expense perspective. See non-freight related <a href="#non">revenue</a> for details.</p>
    <h3>Total Job Cost</h3>
    <p>The <span class="Bold">Total Job Cost</span> is the total of all freight and non-freight related charges. However, the way in which this is calculated depends on the display of the Alloc Amt and Total Amt fields. The display of these fields is controlled by a Job property mentioned above.</p>
    <p>The following rules apply:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If both fields are displayed (default), the Total Job Cost is the sum of the Alloc Amt for each buy shipment plus all non-freight related revenue charges.</li>
      <li>If only the Alloc Amt field appears, the above calculation is also true.</li>
      <li>If only the Total Amt fields appears, the Total Job Cost is the sum of the Total Amt for each buy shipment plus all non-freight related revenue charges.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="Profit" id="Profit"></a>Profit</h2>
    <p>The Profit section shows the total profit (positive amount or loss (negative amount) for the job. Profit is calculated as Total Job Revenue minus the Total Job Cost.</p>
    <p>The property <a href="../properties/glog/job.property.htm#financial.show_profit">glog.job.financial.show_profit</a> enables you to hide or display this section (hidden when false). This can be domain-specific by adding the property as glog.job.financial.show_profit.DOMAIN.</p>
    <h2><a name="display" id="display"></a>Display Option Properties</h2>
    <p>You can control the display of specific columns/data on the Job Details page by configuring several job properties.</p>
