  <h1><span data-field="title" data-format="default">Analytics Pre-defined Dashboards</span></h1>
  <div role="main">
    <p>Transportation Intelligence (TI), Logistics Network Modeling Intelligence, Logistics Machine Learning intelligence, and Global Trade Intelligence (GTI) ship with several pre-defined dashboards. You can consider these dashboards as placeholders. Additional key performance indicators or KPIs can be added to these dashboards but the framework is in place.</p>
    <p class="Note"><span class="Bold">Note</span><span class="Bold">:</span> These pre-configured dashboards are only examples of how to use Transportation Intelligence, Logistics Network Modeling, Logistics Machine Learning intelligence, and Global Trade Intelligence. It is expected that you will configure these dashboards or use them as templates from which to build your own dashboards.</p>
    <p>If you decide to change a pre-defined dashboard, make sure to save a back-up copy. This is important because an upgrade to TI/GTI will replace your edited pre-defined dashboards with the pre-defined dashboards that ship with TI/GTI. You will then need to re-copy your edited pre-defined dashboards back and overwrite the TI/GTI installed ones.</p>
    <p>Let&#39;s look at each of these pre-defined dashboards in more detail:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Transportation Intelligence Dashboards

    </ul>
    <h2><a id="Transportation_Intelligence_Dashboards"></a>Transportation Intelligence Dashboards</h2>
    <p>It is the expectation that the <a href="#main">main</a> and <a href="#servprov">servprov</a> dashboards will be used in a regular transportation situation. The main dashboard is the default dashboard assigned to all new Transportation Intelligence users. They see this default dashboard when they go to <span class="Bold">Transportation Intelligence &gt; Dashboard</span>. This default dashboard can be changed to another Transportation Intelligence pre-defined dashboard or to a user-defined dashboard via <a href="../user_preferences/setting_user_preferences.htm">user preferences</a>. You can also create new menu items that link to dashboards via <a href="../user_management/menu_manager/new_menu_object.htm">menu manager</a>.</p>
    <h3><a name="main" id="main"></a><a href="dashboard.htm">Main Dashboard</a></h3>
    <p>When an Oracle Transportation Management <a href="../user_management/manage_user.htm">user is given access to Transportation Intelligence</a>, by default, they will see the Main Dashboard. They see this default dashboard when they go to <span class="Bold">Transportation Intelligence &gt; Dashboard</span>.</p>
    <p>To learn about the prompts and reports included in this dashboard, see the TI Reference Guide topic titled <a href="reference_guide/dashboard_reports/main_dashboard.htm">Main Dashboard</a>.</p>
    <h3><a name="servprov" id="servprov"></a>Servprov Main Dashboard</h3>
    <p>The Servprov Main Dashboard is similar to the Carrier tab of the Main Dashboard. All of the metrics, targets, and KPIs are the same. This dashboard is only for use with Transportation Intelligence.</p>
    <p>Only users with the Business Intelligence Role of <a href="../planning/power_data/25_general/business_intelligence_role.htm#servprov">SERVPROV</a> can view this dashboard. If you log in as SERVPROV.ADMIN or any other service provider, you will only be able to access the Servprov dashboard regardless of user preferences in OTM and permissions in OAS. In user preferences, if you select a <a href="../user_preferences/setting_user_preferences.htm">Dashboard Preference Value</a> of Servprov Main Dashboard, you must also specify a Business Intelligence Role of SERVPROV on the <a href="../user_management/manage_user.htm">User</a> page. In addition, you must select a <a href="../user_management/user_role.htm">User Role ID</a> that contains a <a href="../user_management/vpd_profile.htm">VPD Profile</a> of SERVPROV.</p>
    <p>To learn about the prompts and reports included in this dashboard, see the TI Reference Guide topic titled <a href="reference_guide/dashboard_reports/servprov_main_dashboard.htm">SERVPROV Main Dashboard</a>.</p>
    <h3><a name="network" id="network"></a>Network Dashboard</h3>
    <p>The Network Dashboard is designed to help you monitor order movements on your network. This dashboard is only for use with Transportation Intelligence. To access this dashboard go to <span class="Bold">Operational Planning &gt; Planning Dashboard</span>.</p>
    <p>This dashboard is just a placeholder. You will need to further define the targets using OAS to add the necessary reports to compare Transportation Intelligence metrics to the targets.</p>
    <p>To learn about the prompts and reports included in this dashboard, see the TI Reference Guide topic titled <a href="reference_guide/dashboard_reports/network_dashboard.htm">Network Dashboard</a>.</p>
    <h3>LSP Dashboards</h3>
    <p>Transportation Intelligence supports logistics service providers (LSPs) and their customers with two specific dashboards. These are LSP Host Dashboard and LSP Customer Dashboard. Each is a variation of the main dashboard used for shippers. These dashboards are only for use with Transportation Intelligence.</p>
    <h4><a name="lsp_host" id="lsp_host"></a>LSP Host Dashboard</h4>
    <p>The LSP host can see more data than each LSP customer. The LSP host can see:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Aggregate data across the customer domains</li>
      <li>Data from a buy perspective, sell perspective, or a comparison of the two</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This dashboard is almost identical to the Main Dashboard with most of the same tabs. To learn about the prompts and reports included in this dashboard, see the TI Reference Guide topic titled <a href="reference_guide/dashboard_reports/lsp_host_dashboard.htm">LSP Host Dashboard</a>.</p>
    <p>In user preferences, if you select a <a href="../user_preferences/setting_user_preferences.htm">Dashboard Preference Value</a> of LSP Host Dashboard, you must also specify a Business Intelligence Role of <a href="../planning/power_data/25_general/business_intelligence_role.htm#lsp_host">LSP HOST</a> on the User page.</p>
    <h4><a name="lsp_cust" id="lsp_cust"></a>LSP Customer Dashboard</h4>
    <p>Each LSP customer is defined by the domain it is in and can only see data in that domain on the dashboard. For an LSP customer, the perspective is always sell. To learn about the prompts and reports included in this dashboard, see the TI Reference Guide topic titled <a href="reference_guide/dashboard_reports/lsp_customer_dashboard.htm">LSP Customer Dashboard</a></p>
    <p>In user preferences, if you select a <a href="../user_preferences/setting_user_preferences.htm">Dashboard Preference Value</a> of LSP Customer Dashboard, you must also specify a Business Intelligence Role of <a href="../planning/power_data/25_general/business_intelligence_role.htm#lsp_cust">LSP CUSTOMER</a> on the User page</p>
